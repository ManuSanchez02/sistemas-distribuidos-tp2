Sun Tzu on Investing: 15 Strategies for Dynamic Investments,"“Some of the wisest words for investors can be found in this book, not only because of Curtis Montgomery’s extensive studies but also by the fascinating framework he uses. Applying Chinese philosophy and particularly that of Sun Tzu to investing make a lot of sense. Sun Tzu’s Art of War contains a great deal of wisdom applicable to investing and Montgomery illustrates this beautifully.” – Mark Mobius, Managing Director, Templeton Emerging Markets Fund, Author of Passport to Profits and Mobius on Emerging Markets “With this book, Curtis Montgomery has provided an enormous service to the investor and he stock market community. This book shows how to apply Sun Tzu’s timeless understanding of strategy to the stock market. Drawing on examples from today, and based on lessons from the past, this book belongs on the bookshelf of every serious investor.” – Franklin Lavin, U.S. Ambassador to Singapore “Investors from all cultures will enjoy Sun Tzu on Investing, as it makes relevant the universal paradox of business that strategy must be like water, with form yet formless, and most robust when it is least rigid. Such ancient Taoist insights are presented here in a fresh and entertaining style that will enlighten every investing mind.” – Dr. Ron Sim, Chief Executive Officer, OSIM International Ltd. “Few Westerners have such a deep grasp of the Taoist philosophy of Sun Tzu as Curtis Montgomery.

Darwin and the Beagle,"The riveting firsthand account of the historic voyage that led to the theory of evolution When the HMS Beagle set sail in 1831, the science of biology was not far removed from the Dark Ages. When the ship returned to England nearly five years later, Charles Darwin had the makings of a theory that would revolutionize our understanding of the natural world. From volcanoes in the Galapagos to the coral reefs of Australia, The Voyage of the Beagle documents the young naturalist’s encounters with some of the earth’s most stunning features. Darwin’s observations of the people, places, and events he experienced make for compelling reading and offer a fascinating window into the intellectual development of his ideas about natural selection.

Coming of Age in Samoa,"Rarely do science and literature come together in the same book. When they do -- as in Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species, for example -- they become classics, quoted and studied by scholars and the general public alike. Margaret Mead accomplished this remarkable feat not once but several times, beginning with Coming of Age in Samoa. It details her historic journey to American Samoa, taken where she was just twenty-three, where she did her first fieldwork. Here, for the first time, she presented to the public the idea that the individual experience of developmental stages could be shaped by cultural demands and expectations. Adolescence, she wrote, might be more or less stormy, and sexual development more or less problematic in different cultures. The ""civilized"" world, she taught us had much to learn from the ""primitive.""

"First principles,","This volume presents an interconnected set of sixteen essays, four of which are previously unpublished, by Allan Gotthelf—one of the leading experts in the study of Aristotle's biological writings. Gotthelf addresses three main topics across Aristotle's three main biological treatises. Starting with his own ground-breaking study of Aristotle's natural teleology and its illuminating relationship with the Generation of Animals, Gotthelf proceeds to the axiomatic structure of biological explanation (and the first principles such explanation proceeds from) in the Parts of Animals. After an exploration of the implications of these two treatises for our understanding of Aristotle's metaphysics, Gotthelf examines important aspects of the method by which Aristotle organizes his data in the History of Animals to make possible such a systematic, explanatory study of animals, offering a new view of the place of classification in that enterprise. In a concluding section on 'Aristotle as Theoretical Biologist', Gotthelf explores the basis of Charles Darwin's great praise of Aristotle and, in the first printing of a lecture delivered worldwide, provides an overview of Aristotle as a philosophically-oriented scientist, and 'a proper verdict' on his greatness as scientist.",['Allan Gotthelf'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=FwNREAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.nl/books?id=FwNREAAAQBAJ&pg=PA157&dq=First+principles,&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",Oxford University Press,2012-02-23,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=FwNREAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Philosophy'],
The Evolution of Intelligence,"How is one to understand the nature of intelligence? One approach is through psychometric testing, but such an approach often puts the ""cart before the horse""--the test before the theory. Another approach is to use evolutionary theory. This criterion has been suggested by a number of individuals in the past, from Charles Darwin in the more distant past to Howard Gardner, Stephen Gould, Steven Pinker, Carl Sagan, David Stenhouse, and many others. The chapters in this book address three major questions: 1. Does evolutionary theory help us understand the nature of human intelligence? 2. If so, what does it tell us about the nature of human intelligence? 3. And if so, how has intelligence evolved? The goal of this book is to present diverse points of view on the evolution of intelligence as offered by leading experts in the field. In particular, it may be possible to better understand the nature and societal implications of intelligence by understanding how and why it has evolved as it has. This book is unique in offering a diversity of points of view on the topic of the evolution of human intelligence.","['Robert J. Sternberg', 'James C.

Evolution: A Very Short Introduction,"Less than 450 years ago, all European scholars believed that the Earth was at the centre of a Universe that was at most a few million miles in extent, and that the planets, sun, and stars all rotated around this centre. Less than 250 years ago, they believed that the Universe was createdessentially in its present state about 6000 years ago. Even less than 150 years ago, the view that living species were the result of special creation by God was still dominant. The recognition by Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace of the mechanism of evolution by natural selection hascompletely transformed our understanding of the living world, including our own origins. In this Very Short Introduction Brian and Deborah Charlesworth provide a clear and concise summary of the process of evolution by natural selection, and how natural selection gives rise to adaptations and eventually, over many generations, to new species. They introduce the central concepts of thefield of evolutionary biology, as they have developed since Darwin and Wallace on the subject, over 140 years ago, and discuss some of the remaining questions regarding processes. They highlight the wide range of evidence for evolution, and the importance of an evolutionary understanding forinstance in combating the rapid evolution of resistance by bacteria to antibiotics and of HIV to antiviral drugs. This reissue includes some key updates to the main text and a completely updated Further Reading section.ABOUT THE SERIES: The Very Short Introductions series from Oxford University Press contains hundreds of titles in almost every subject area.

"MADE IN AMERICA: SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, AND AMERICAN MODERNIST POETS","Over the last thirty years, more and more critics and scholars have come to recognize the importance of science to literature. 'Science in Modern Poetry: New Directions' is the first collection of essays to focus specifically on what poets in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries have made of the scientific developments going on around them. In a collection of twelve essays, leading experts on modern poetry and on literature and science explore how poets have used scientific language in their poems, how poetry can offer new perspectives on science, and how the 'Two Cultures' can and have come together in the work of poets from Britain and Ireland, America and Australia. What does the poetry of a leading immunologist and a Nobel-Prize-winning chemist tell us about how poetry can engage with science? Scientific experiments aim to yield knowledge, but what do the linguistic and formal experiments of contemporary American poets suggest about knowledge in their turn? How can universities help to bring these different experimental cultures and practices together? What questions do literary critics need to ask themselves when looking at poems that respond to science? How did developments in biology between the wars shape modernist poetry? What did William Empson make of science fiction, Ezra Pound of the fourth dimension, Thomas Hardy of anthropology? How did modern poets from W. B. Yeats to Elizabeth Bishop and Judith Wright respond to the legacy of Charles Darwin? This book aims to answer these questions and more, in the process setting out the state of the field and suggesting new directions and approaches for research by students and scholars working on the fertile relationship between science and poetry today.",['John Holmes'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=EHVvEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.com/books?id=EHVvEAAAQBAJ&pg=PA7&dq=MADE+IN+AMERICA:+SCIENCE,+TECHNOLOGY,+AND+AMERICAN+MODERNIST+POETS&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",Liverpool University Press,2012-03-31,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=EHVvEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Literary Criticism'],

Galileo's Commandment: An Anthology of Great Science Writing,"Marie Curie reminisces about her and her husband's efforts to isolate the element radium. Herodotus observes the Nile Valley and concludes that it was once under water. Carl Sagan argues against assertions that aliens regularly visit Earth. These are among the literary gems Edmund Blair Bolles includes in GALILEO'S COMMANDMENT. Bolles has scoured the literature of science to build a treasury that is accessible and riveting, appealing to readers unfamiliar with science yet erudite enough for the scientifically initiated reader to enjoy. The authors include scientists well-known for their writing - including Stephen Jay Gould, Richard Feynman and Charles Darwin - and scientists such as Kepler, James Clerk Maxwell, Alfred Wallace, and of course Galileo himself.

Mary Anning: The Fossil Hunter (Remarkable Children),"At a time when women were excluded from science, a young girl made a discovery that marked the birth of paleontology and continues to feed the debate about evolution to this day. Mary Anning was only twelve years old when, in 1811, she discovered the first dinosaur skeleton--of an ichthyosaur--while fossil hunting on the cliffs of Lyme Regis, England. Until Mary's incredible discovery, it was widely believed that animals did not become extinct. The child of a poor family, Mary became a fossil hunter, inspiring the tongue-twister, ""She Sells Sea Shells by the Seashore."" She attracted the attention of fossil collectors and eventually the scientific world. Once news of the fossils reached the halls of academia, it became impossible to ignore the truth. Mary's peculiar finds helped lay the groundwork for Charles Darwin's theory of evolution, laid out in his On the Origin of Species. Darwin drew on Mary's fossilized creatures as irrefutable evidence that life in the past was nothing like life in the present. A story worthy of Dickens, The Fossil Hunter chronicles the life of this young girl, with dirt under her fingernails and not a shilling to buy dinner, who became a world-renowned paleontologist. Dickens himself said of Mary: ""The carpenter's daughter has won a name for herself, and deserved to win it."" Here at last, Shelley Emling returns Mary Anning, of whom Stephen J. Gould remarked, is ""probably the most important unsung (or inadequately sung) collecting force in the history of paleontology,"" to her deserved place in history.",['Shelley Emling'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Y4NvIGkAJ70C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=Y4NvIGkAJ70C&pg=PP1&dq=Mary+Anning:+The+Fossil+Hunter+(Remarkable+Children)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,St. Martin's Press,2009-10-13,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Y4NvIGkAJ70C&source=gbs_api,['Biography & Autobiography'],6.0
On Evolution,"The father of evolution imbibed history with his controversial book On the Origin of Species. As a young scientist studying natural history, Charles Darwin set out on the HMS Beagle for a five-year voyage that would bring him in contact with animal species, plant species, and rock formations all over the world. This voyage established him as an eminent geologist, and his publication of his journal of the voyage established him as a well-known popular author. After continued, careful studying of his findings from his trip around the world, he published one of the most controversial books of history—The Origin of Species—which opposed the church’s theory that all species had come into existence at the time of the Creation. Darwin on Evolution contains quotes and wisdom from The Origin of Species, as well as from his other publications, pertaining to his theories of evolution and natural selection. Readers young and old alike will have the opportunity to learn more about his theories while also taking away important life lessons. As Darwin says, “In the long history of humankind (and animal kind, too) those who learned to collaborate and improvise most effectively have prevailed.”",['Charles Darwin'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=iS2CDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=iS2CDwAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=On+Evolution&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Simon and Schuster,2015-06-02,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=iS2CDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Science'],

"Defining the Wind: The Beaufort Scale, and How a 19th Century Admiral Turned Science Into Poetry","“Nature, rightly questioned, never lies.” —A Manual of Scientific Enquiry, Third Edition, 1859 Scott Huler was working as a copy editor for a small publisher when he stumbled across the Beaufort Wind Scale in his Merriam Webster Collegiate Dictionary. It was one of those moments of discovery that writers live for. Written centuries ago, its 110 words launched Huler on a remarkable journey over land and sea into a fascinating world of explorers, mariners, scientists, and writers. After falling in love with what he decided was “the best, clearest, and most vigorous piece of descriptive writing I had ever seen,” Huler went in search of Admiral Francis Beaufort himself: hydrographer to the British Admiralty, man of science, and author—Huler assumed—of the Beaufort Wind Scale. But what Huler discovered is that the scale that carries Beaufort’s name has a long and complex evolution, and to properly understand it he had to keep reaching farther back in history, into the lives and works of figures from Daniel Defoe and Charles Darwin to Captains Bligh, of the Bounty, and Cook, of the Endeavor. As hydrographer to the British Admiralty it was Beaufort’s job to track the information that ships relied on: where to lay anchor, descriptions of ports, information about fortification, religion, and trade. But what came to fascinate Huler most about Beaufort was his obsession for observing things and communicating to others what the world looked like. Huler’s research landed him in one of the most fascinating and rich periods of history, because all around the world in the mid-eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, in a grand, expansive period, modern science was being invented every day. These scientific advancements encompassed not only vast leaps in understanding but also how scientific innovation was expressed and even organized, including such enduring developments as the scale Anders Celsius created to simplify how Gabriel Fahrenheit measured temperature; the French-designed metric system; and the Gregorian calendar adopted by France and Great Britain. To Huler, Beaufort came to embody that passion for scientific observation and categorization; indeed Beaufort became the great scientific networker of his time. It was he, for example, who was tapped to lead the search for a naturalist in the 1830s to accompany the crew of the Beagle; he recommended a young naturalist named Charles Darwin. Defining the Wind is a wonderfully readable, often humorous, and always rich story that is ultimately about how we observe the forces of nature and the world around us.",['Scott Huler'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=oqGUXPWbieMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.com/books?id=oqGUXPWbieMC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Defining+the+Wind:+The+Beaufort+Scale,+and+How+a+19th+Century+Admiral+Turned+Science+Into+Poetry&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",Crown,2007-12-18,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=oqGUXPWbieMC&source=gbs_api,['Science'],2.0

Humboldt's Cosmos,"From 1799 to 1804, German naturalist and adventurer Alexander von Humboldt conducted the first extensive scientific exploration of Latin America. At the completion of his arduous 6,000-mile journey, he was feted by Thomas Jefferson, presented to Napoleon and, after the publication of his findings, hailed as the greatest scientific genius of his age. Humboldt’s Cosmos tells the story of this extraordinary man who was equal parts Einstein and Livingstone, and of the adventure that defined his life. Gerard Helferich vividly recounts Humboldt’s expedition through the Amazon, over the Andes, and across Mexico and Cuba, highlighting his paradigm-changing discoveries along the way. During the course of the expedition, Humboldt cataloged more than 60,000 plants, set an altitude record climbing the volcano Chimborazo, and introduced millions of Europeans and Americans to the great cultures of the Inca and the Aztecs. In the process, he also revolutionized geology and laid the groundwork for modern sciences such as climatology, oceanography, and geography. His contributions would profoundly influence future greats such as Charles Darwin and shape the course of science for centuries to come. Humboldt’s Cosmos is a dramatic tribute to one of history’s most audacious adventurers, who, as Stephen Jay Gould noted, ""may well have been the world’s most famous and influential intellectual.""",['Gerard Helferich'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=xzxkOH5FymAC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=xzxkOH5FymAC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Humboldt%27s+Cosmos&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Tantor eBooks,2011-08-31,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=xzxkOH5FymAC&source=gbs_api,['Science'],

The Coming of Age in Samoa,"The groundbreaking classic detailing Margaret Mead's first field work at age 23, establishing Mead’s core insights into childhood and culture that challenged and changed our view of life. Rarely do science and literature come together in the same book. When they do -- as in Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species, for example -- they become classics, quoted and studied by scholars and the general public alike. Margaret Mead accomplished this remarkable feat not once but several times, beginning with Coming of Age in Samoa. It details her historic journey to American Samoa, taken when she was just twenty-three, where she did her first fieldwork. Here, for the first time, she presented to the public the idea that the individual experience of developmental stages could be shaped by cultural demands and expectations. Adolescence, she wrote, might be more or less stormy, and sexual development more or less problematic in different cultures. Mead’s revolutionary book, dedicated to the girls of Tau, was one of the first studies to pay attention to girls’ lives. Her keen observations contain many ideas that are still powerful today—that sexuality is culturally-shaped, that adolescence need not be stressful, and that the lives of adolescent girls are worthy of attention and respect. Now this groundbreaking, beautifully written work as been reissued for the centennial of Mead's birth, featuring introductions by Mary Pipher, Ph.D. (Reviving Ophelia) and by Mead's daughter, Mary Catherine Bateso (Composing a Life).",['Margaret Mead'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=3HSSCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=3HSSCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Coming+of+Age+in+Samoa&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,HarperCollins,2016-05-10,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=3HSSCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Social Science'],3.0

Tales From The Underground: A Natural History Of Subterranean Life,"There are over one billion organisms in a pinch of soil, yet we know much more about deep space than about the universe below. In Tales from the Underground, Cornell ecologist David Wolfe takes us on a tour through current scientific knowledge of the subterranean world. We follow the progress of discovery from Charles Darwin's experiments with earthworms, to Lewis and Clark's first encounter with prairie dogs, to the use of new genetic tools that are revealing an astonishingly rich ecosystem beneath our feet. Wolfe plunges us deep into the earth's rocky crust, where life may have begun-a world devoid of oxygen and light but safe from asteroid bombardment. Primitive microbes found there are turning our notion of the evolutionary tree of life on its head: amazingly, they represent perhaps a full third of earth's genetic diversity. As Wolfe explains, creatures of the soil can work for us, by providing important pharmaceuticals and recycling the essential elements of life, or against us, by spreading disease and contributing to global climate change. The future of our species may well depend on how we manage our living soil resources. Tales from the Underground will forever alter our appreciation of the natural world around-and beneath-us.",['David Wolfe'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=mwc4DgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=mwc4DgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Tales+From+The+Underground:+A+Natural+History+Of+Subterranean+Life&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Hachette UK,2009-04-28,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=mwc4DgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Science'],1.0

La Tierra del Fuego (Spanish Edition),"Tierra del Fuego is a suspenseful seafaring tale in the tradition of Horatio Hornblower, enriched by a chilling psychological and cultural tale that probes deeply into human nature - one reminiscent of Heart of Darkness or Lord of the Flies. It is based on the true story of the Yamana Indian, Jemmy Button, parts of which are recorded in Chapter 10 of Charles Darwin's The Voyage of the Beagle. This novel explores Captain Robert Fitzroy's abduction of Jemmy Button from his home in Cape Horn and Fitzroy's attempt to ""civilize"" Button in England in order to return him to his country as a bearer of ""enlightened society."" The experiment leads to tragic consequences. Tierra del Fuego deals with European arrogance and exploitation without resorting to the cliche of the ""Noble Savage."" The tale is told from the point of view of John William Guevera, an ""outsider"" with an English father and Argentinean mother. Guevera, living between those two worlds, is one of the few characters in the novel who can foresee the tragic consequences of the ""experiment"" and who can best understand Jemmy Button and the political machinery behind the curtain of ""civilized society.""",['Sylvia Iparraguirre'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=OH5fAAAAMAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=OH5fAAAAMAAJ&q=La+Tierra+del+Fuego+(Spanish+Edition)&dq=La+Tierra+del+Fuego+(Spanish+Edition)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,,2000,http://books.google.com/books?id=OH5fAAAAMAAJ&dq=La+Tierra+del+Fuego+(Spanish+Edition)&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],
"The Nick of Time: Politics, Evolution, and the Untimely","In this pathbreaking philosophical work, Elizabeth Grosz points the way toward a theory of becoming to replace the prevailing ontologies of being in social, political, and biological discourse. Arguing that theories of temporality have significant and underappreciated relevance to the social dimensions of science and the political dimensions of struggle, Grosz engages key theoretical concerns related to the reality of time. She explores the effect of time on the organization of matter and on the emergence and development of biological life. Considering how the relentless forward movement of time might be conceived in political and social terms, she begins to formulate a model of time that incorporates the future and its capacity to supersede and transform the past and present. Grosz develops her argument by juxtaposing the work of three major figures in Western thought: Charles Darwin, Friedrich Nietzsche, and Henri Bergson. She reveals that in theorizing time as an active, positive phenomenon with its own characteristics and specific effects, each of these thinkers had a profound effect on contemporary understandings of the body in relation to time. She shows how their allied concepts of life, evolution, and becoming are manifest in the work of Gilles Deleuze and Luce Irigaray. Throughout The Nick of Time, Grosz emphasizes the political and cultural imperative to fundamentally rethink time: the more clearly we understand our temporal location as beings straddling the past and the future without the security of a stable and abiding present, the more transformation becomes conceivable.",['Elizabeth Grosz'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=feR5UWpCA5cC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.com/books?id=feR5UWpCA5cC&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Nick+of+Time:+Politics,+Evolution,+and+the+Untimely&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",Duke University Press,2004-11-15,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=feR5UWpCA5cC&source=gbs_api,['Philosophy'],
After Grapes Of Wrath: Essays On John Steinbeck,"Traditionally, the critical reputation of Nobel Prize-winning American novelist John Steinbeck (1902-1968) has rested on his achievements of the 1930s, especially In Dubious Battle (1936), Of Mice and Men (1937), The Long Valley (1938), and, of course, The Grapes of Wrath (1939), one of the most powerful - and arguable on of the greatest - American novels of this century. Book reviewers and academic critics often turned antagonistic toward Steinbeck when he no longer produced work with the sweeping reach and social consciousness of The Grapes of Wrath. He was accused of selling out, or co-opting his talent, when in fact the inordinate public success of Grapes and especially its attendant notoriety had caused a backlash for Steinbeck. As a result he became self-conscious about his own ability, and suspicious of that ""clumsy vehicle,"" the novel. The very act of researching and writing Grapes, which occupied him fully for several years and which he had already conceived as his final book on proletarian themes, changed him drastically. No longer willing to be the chronicler of Depression-era subjects, Steinbeck went afield to find new roots, new sources, new forms. For example, in the six years following the publication of Grapes, Steinbeck completed a suit of love poems; a full-length novel (bastardized by Alfred Hitchcock in his 1943 film, Lifeboat); a nonfiction scientific book, Sea of Cortez: A Leisurely Journal of Travel and Research (with Edward F. Ricketts); a documentary film, The Forgotten Village; a documentary book to help the war effort, Bombs Away: The Story of a Bomber Team; a series of articles he wrote as a war correspondent for the New York Herald Tribune (later collected as Once There Was a War); and two novels, The Moon Is Down and Cannery Row. Steinbeck came to define himself less as a novelist and more as a man of letters, a restless experimenter with form and subject matter, and a prophetic postmodernist whose key subject for the rest of his career was the dilemma of individual choice and ethical consciousness. Thus, Steinbeck's later fiction, from The Moon Is Down (1942) through The Winter of Our Discontent (1962), and his later nonfiction, from Sea of Cortez (1941) through Travels with Charley (1962) and America and Americans (1966), often shows a different set of stylistic, thematic, and philosophical bearings from his earlier work and underscores his dramatic shift toward ""individual thinking."" A full appreciation of Steinbeck's mid-career metamorphosis and, consequently, of his later achievement requires a corresponding shift in critical approach - a departure from the traditional New Critical norms. Instead of marginalizing these works, all the contributors to this volume agree that Steinbeck's later publications merit - indeed, demand - closer scrutiny. Written especially for this collection in honor of Professor Tetsumaro Hayashi, the distinguished founder and editor-in-chief of the Steinbeck Quarterly, on his retirement from Ball State University and his move to Kwassui Women's College in Nagasaki, Japan, these essays explore new ways of addressing Steinbeck's later work and career, and include forays into subjects as diverse as ethnicity and music. They range from treatment of his post-structuralist use of language in Sea of Cortez and his involvement as a speech writer for Franklin Delano Roosevelt's reelection bid in 1944 to the influence of Charles Darwin's theories of sexual selection in The Wayward Bus, his revision of the myth of Cain in The Winter of Our Discontent, and his employment of Arthurian quest values in his last book, America and Americans. For this group of critics - which includes respected veteran Steinbeck scholars Robert DeMott, John Ditsky, Mimi Gladstein, Cliff Lewis, Robert Morsberger, Susan Shillinglaw, and Roy Simmonds, as well as talented new voices Debra Barker, Kevin Hearle, Michael Meyer, Brian Railsback, Eiko Shiraga, and Geralyn Strecker - The Moon is Down and The Wayward Bus loom as significant works in the post 1930s re-evaluation (two essays each appear on these works). The book also includes Donald Coers's interview with the writer's widow, Elaine Steinbeck, the first of its kind ever published. After The Grapes of Wrath opens with eminent Americanist Warren French's appreciation of Professor Hayashi's distinguished career and his influence in Steinbeck studies; a bibliography of Hayashi's major publication concludes this honorary gathering.","['Donald V.

Unexpected Universe,"“No one has ever managed to make the pursuit of knowledge feel more soulful or more immediate than Loren Eiseley . . . ” —Ben Cosgrove, The Daily Beast At the height of a distinguished career as a paleontologist, Loren Eiseley turned from fieldwork and scientific publication to the personal essay. Here, in The Unexpected Universe, he displays his far-reaching knowledge and searching curiosity about the natural world, and the qualities that led many to hail him as a “modern Thoreau.” Fascinating accounts of the journeys of Odysseus, Captain Cook, and Charles Darwin frame Eiseley’s more modest wanderings as a suburban naturalist, attentive to the lives of small creatures. Sometimes he travels no further than the local dump. And yet, like Homer’s hero or these great explorers, he continually finds a universe “not only queerer than we suppose, but queerer than we can suppose.”",['Loren Eiseley'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=IY9PDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=IY9PDQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Unexpected+Universe&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Library of America,2016-11-15,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=IY9PDQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Science'],3.0

If Darwin had one goal with Expression, it was to demonstrate the power of his theories for explaining the origin of our most cherished human qualities: morality and intellect.

The Third Secret: A Quest for the Truth Could Change the World,"Scientist Charles Darwin discretely opened the possibility of a purely animalistic origin for the human species. He repeatedly insisted that the differences between humans and others were a question of degree only. Sciences were, however, taken in the opposite direction, where these differences cannot have been generated by the natural processes of biological evolution. In The Animal in the Secret World of Darwin, author Michel Bergeron discuses the effects on the sciences caused by the presence of questions on humanity only answerable with religious beliefs. His investigation suggests that significant elements of perceived humanity have remained sufficiently narrowly defined to continue to agree with religious beliefs over the entire period starting with the scientific revolution centuries ago and reaching the present. Instead, he questions, could we be the simple animal who can only live on the belief not to be a simple animal? To alleviate these biases on the sciences of life, Bergeron advocates a different synthesis between Darwinism and Lamarckism. He further asks: How can sciences pretend to a cosmology neutral in term of religious influence since all of its complex mathematical developments were made under the constraint that we can link the present directly to the Big Bang?",['Michel Bergeron'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=nFhR9tJLPyEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=nFhR9tJLPyEC&pg=PA75&dq=The+Third+Secret:+A+Quest+for+the+Truth+Could+Change+the+World&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,iUniverse,2011-03-03,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=nFhR9tJLPyEC&source=gbs_api,['Science'],
the frog pond,"The philanthropist and philosopher Strachan Donnelley (1942--2008) devoted his life to studying the complex relationship between humans and nature. Founder and first president of the Center for Humans and Nature, Donnelley was a pioneer in the exploration and promotion of the idea that human beings individually and collectively have moral and civic responsibilities to natural ecosystems. In this wide-ranging volume, Donnelley traces the connections between influential figures such as Aldo Leopold and Charles Darwin, as well as lesser-known but original thinkers that he met during the course of a full life -- ministers at his church, friends with whom he fished, and colleagues who shared his passion for research and writing. He grounds his work in classic philosophers such as Descartes, Spinoza, and Whitehead and reinterprets their writings about the natural world to develop a conservation-centered philosophy, which he dubs ""democratic ecological citizenship."" Edited by his daughter, Ceara Donnelley, and Bruce Jennings, Frog Pond Philosophy illuminates the dominant strands of Donnelley's intellectual identity as a philosopher, naturalist, agitator, and spiritualist. Despite his often grim depiction of the current state of the environment, Donnelly never surrenders his faith in humanity's ability to meet its ethical obligations to conserve, respect, and nurture the complexity and diversity of the natural world.

The greatest gift guide ever,"As a child in a non-religious family, Michael Ridenour found a Bible one day and began reading. Initially excited by its lively stories, he paused at the New Testament, faced with a baffling inner question: Where in the world is Christ today? An unexpected answer came during his teenage years with a spontaneous experience of the Christ being, but this only led to more questions. Later, discovering the work of Rudolf Steiner, he found the authentic vision and language he needed to clarify and better comprehend his own experiences, but the questions kept coming. The Greatest Gift Ever Given is a fruit of Ridenour’s life-long search for answers: a book that is at once deeply thoughtful, humorous, philosophical and poetic. In Part I, ‘Raising the Foundation’, he studies the Judeo-Christian mysteries. After humanity’s ‘fall’ into materialism, these mysteries signal the development of human individuality. The impulse for self-hood continues with Christ, who brings a new path of divine love. But the mystery of Christ leads naturally to his shadow. Today, we can no longer escape the question: Where in the world is Judas? Without Judas’s betrayal, Christ’s greatest gift could never have been given. We can’t reject Judas, but should transform him within ourselves. In Part II, ‘Lowering the Temple’, Ridenour relates the theme of metamorphosis to the contemporary world. Once guided by initiates, personal transformation now needs to blossom from within each individual human soul. The topic of evolution takes us to a consideration of the perennially-controversial Charles Darwin, as well as the intuitive approach of Goethe and the living thinking of Rudolf Steiner. A rich treasure-trove of ideas, The Greatest Gift Ever Given sharpens a dynamic focus on current spiritual needs and contributes a thought-provoking response to them.",['Michael S.

The Life of a Fossil Hunter (Age of Dinosaurs),"At a time when women were excluded from science, a young girl made a discovery that marked the birth of paleontology and continues to feed the debate about evolution to this day. Mary Anning was only twelve years old when, in 1811, she discovered the first dinosaur skeleton--of an ichthyosaur--while fossil hunting on the cliffs of Lyme Regis, England. Until Mary's incredible discovery, it was widely believed that animals did not become extinct. The child of a poor family, Mary became a fossil hunter, inspiring the tongue-twister, ""She Sells Sea Shells by the Seashore."" She attracted the attention of fossil collectors and eventually the scientific world. Once news of the fossils reached the halls of academia, it became impossible to ignore the truth. Mary's peculiar finds helped lay the groundwork for Charles Darwin's theory of evolution, laid out in his On the Origin of Species. Darwin drew on Mary's fossilized creatures as irrefutable evidence that life in the past was nothing like life in the present. A story worthy of Dickens, The Fossil Hunter chronicles the life of this young girl, with dirt under her fingernails and not a shilling to buy dinner, who became a world-renowned paleontologist. Dickens himself said of Mary: ""The carpenter's daughter has won a name for herself, and deserved to win it."" Here at last, Shelley Emling returns Mary Anning, of whom Stephen J. Gould remarked, is ""probably the most important unsung (or inadequately sung) collecting force in the history of paleontology,"" to her deserved place in history.",['Shelley Emling'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=Y4NvIGkAJ70C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=Y4NvIGkAJ70C&pg=PP1&dq=The+Life+of+a+Fossil+Hunter+(Age+of+Dinosaurs)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,St. Martin's Press,2009-10-13,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=Y4NvIGkAJ70C&source=gbs_api,['Biography & Autobiography'],6.0

On the Origin of the Species (Easton Press The 100 Greatest Books Ever Written),"A new, deluxe hardcover edition of one of the most important scientific works ever written In December 1831, Charles Darwin boarded the HMS Beagle, accompanying her crew on a five-year journey that crossed the Atlantic Ocean to survey the coasts of South America. As the expedition’s geologist and naturalist, Darwin collected evidence from the Galapagos Islands and other locations which prompted him to speculate that species evolve over generations through a process of natural selection. In 1859, Darwin published On the Origin of Species, a work of scientific literature considered to be the foundation of evolutionary biology. His revolutionary work presented evidence from the Beagle expedition as well as from years of subsequent research and experimentation. Written for non-specialists, Darwin’s book gained widespread interest from the scientific community, religious leaders, politicians and the general public. The theory Darwin presented in his book quickly became the subject of heated debate and discussion. Now accepted by the scientific community, Darwin’s concepts of evolutionary adaptation via natural selection are central to modern evolutionary theory and form the foundation of modern life sciences. Perhaps the most transformative scientific volume ever published, this volume of the first edition of On the Origin of Species: Outlines Darwin’s ideas, scientific influences and the core of his theory Details natural selection and address possible objections to the theory Examines the fossil record and biogeography to support evolutionary adaptation Features a ""Recapitulation and Conclusion"" which reviews key concepts and considers the future relevance of Darwin’s theory On the Origin of Species: The Science Classic is an important addition to the bestselling Capstone Classics series edited by Tom Butler-Bowdon. It includes an insightful Introduction from leading Darwin scholar Dr John van Wyhe of the University of Singapore, which presents new research and an offers an original perspective on Darwin and his famous work.

The Truth About Human Origins,"Ever since Charles Darwin first published The Origin of Species on November 24, 1859, the subject of origins has been one of the most controversial topics around. Sadly, it also is a subject that is fraught with erroneous theories and concepts. Most students today are taught that organic evolution is not a theory, but a ""fact"" that all ""reputable scientists"" accept. Disclaimers from the evolutionary community notwithstanding, such a claim is, quite simply, wrong. We believe it is time for someone to offer what renowned news commentator Paul Harvey would call ""the rest of the story."" That is what The Truth About Human Origins does. It tells the rest of the story as it discusses the scientific facts about mankind's beginning. For example, it investigates the ""record of the rocks"" as that record relates to human evolution. It demonstrates how evolutionary theory is unable to explain things like the origin of gender and sexual reproduction, the origin of language and communication, the origin of the brain, the mind, and human consciousness, and the origin of skin colors and blood types. It also examines in an in-depth fashion the so-called ""molecular evidence"" of human evolution.","['Brad Harrub', 'Bert Thompson']",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=J9pON9yB8HkC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=J9pON9yB8HkC&pg=PP1&dq=The+Truth+About+Human+Origins&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Apologetics Press Inc.,2003,http://books.google.com/books?id=J9pON9yB8HkC&dq=The+Truth+About+Human+Origins&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Religion'],2.0
Architects of the Culture of Death,"The phrase, ""the Culture of Death"", is bandied about as a catch-all term that covers abortion, euthanasia and other attacks on the sanctity of life. In Architects of the Culture of Death, authors Donald DeMarco and Benjamin Wiker expose the Culture of Death as an intentional and malevolent ideology promoted by influential thinkers who specifically attack Christian morality's core belief in the sanctity of human life and the existence of man's immortal soul. In scholarly, yet reader-friendly prose, DeMarco and Wiker examine the roots of the Culture of Death by introducing 23 of its architects, including Ayn Rand, Charles Darwin, Karl Marx, Jean-Paul Sartre, Alfred Kinsey, Margaret Sanger, Jack Kevorkian, and Peter Singer. Still, this is not a book without hope. If the Culture of Death rests on a fragmented view of the person and an eclipse of God, the future of the Culture of Life relies on an understanding and restoration of the human being as a person, and the rediscovery of a benevolent God. The personalism of John Paul II is an illuminating thread that runs through Architects, serving as a hopeful antidote.","['Donald De Marco', 'Benjamin Wiker']",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=x1d4DQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=x1d4DQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Architects+of+the+Culture+of+Death&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Ignatius Press,2016-10-25,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=x1d4DQAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Religion'],

"Evolution, the modern synthesis","The definitive edition of one of the most important scientific books of the twentieth century, setting out the conceptual structure underlying evolutionary biology. This classic work by Julian Huxley, first published in 1942, captured and synthesized all that was then known about evolutionary biology and gave a name to the Modern Synthesis, the conceptual structure underlying the field for most of the twentieth century. Many considered Huxley's book a popularization of the ideas then emerging in evolutionary biology, but in fact Evolution: The Modern Synthesis is a work of serious scholarship that is also accessible to the general educated public. It is a book in the intellectual tradition of Charles Darwin and Thomas Henry Huxley—Julian Huxley's grandfather, known for his energetic championing of Darwin's ideas. A contemporary reviewer called Evolution: The Modern Synthesis “the outstanding evolutionary treatise of the decade, perhaps the century.” This definitive edition brings one of the most important and successful scientific books of the twentieth century back into print. It includes the entire text of the 1942 edition, Huxley's introduction to the 1963 second edition (which demonstrates his continuing command of the field), and the introduction to the 1974 third edition, written by nine experts (many of them Huxley's associates) from different areas of evolutionary biology.",['Julian S.

If Darwin had one goal with Expression, it was to demonstrate the power of his theories for explaining the origin of our most cherished human qualities: morality and intellect.

Love Letters of Great Men and Women,"Remember the wonderfully romantic book of love letters that Carrie reads aloud to Big in the recent blockbuster film, Sex and the City? Fans raced to buy copies of their own, only to find out that the beautiful book didn't actually exist. However, since all of the letters referenced in the film did exist, we decided to publish this gorgeous keepsake ourselves. Love Letters of Great Men follows hot on the heels of the film and collects together some of history's most romantic letters from the private papers of Beethoven, Mark Twain, Mozart, and Lord Byron. For some of these great men, love is ""a delicious poison"" (William Congreve); for others, ""a nice soft wife on a sofa with good fire, & books & music"" (Charles Darwin). Love can scorch like the heat of the sun (Henry VIII), or penetrate the depths of one's heart like a cooling rain (Flaubert). Every shade of love is here, from the exquisite eloquence of Oscar Wilde and the simple devotion of Robert Browning, to the wonderfully modern misery of the Roman Pliny the Younger, losing himself in work to forget how much he misses his beloved wife, Calpurnia. Taken together, these letters show that perhaps men haven't changed all that much over the last 2,000 years--passion, jealousy, hope and longing still rule their hearts and minds. In an age of e-mail and texted ""i luv u""s, this timeless and unique collection reminds us that nothing can compare to the simple joy of sitting down to read a letter from the one you love.",['Ursula Doyle'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1_ll1lXPY0MC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=1_ll1lXPY0MC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Love+Letters+of+Great+Men+and+Women&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,St. Martin's Press,2008-11-25,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=1_ll1lXPY0MC&source=gbs_api,['Literary Collections'],3.0

Ben Holladay: The Stagecoach King,"The red and black Concord stagecoaches that crossed the West in the 1860s, known to the Indians as ""fire boxes,"" have been celebrated in Mark Twain's fiction and JohnøFord's films. Predating the transcontinental railroads, they provided vital lines of communication to the East during the Civil War and opened to development the newly settled regions beyond the Missouri River. From 1862 to 1866 Ben Holladay owned and operated a network of stagecoach lines from Kansas to California, the main one following the central mail route between Atchison and Salt Lake City established by the U.S. government in 1848, and other lines branching into the mining country of California and Montana and Idaho territories. In spite of bad weather, primitive roads, holdups by highwaymen, and trouble with Indians, Holladay's coaches delivered passengers and mail on schedule. J. V. Frederick describes in fascinating detail the organization and operation of a vast transportation empire ruled by a man with executive genius and a gambler's instincts. Although Holladay forbade drinking and profanity on the job, he commanded the loyalty of his drivers, whom he dressed in broad-brimmed sombreros, corduroys trimmed with velvet, and high-heeled boots. He sold out just before the Union Pacific Railroad was completed and until his death in 1887 remained popular with Americans, who named racehorses and cigars after him.",['J. V.

A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Oxford World's Classics),"When A Connecticut Yankee at King Arthur's Court was published in 1889, Mark Twain was undergoing a series of personal and professional crises. Thus what began as a literary burlesque of British chivalry and culture grew into a disturbing satire of modern technology and social thought. The story of Hank Morgan, a nineteenth-century American who is accidentally returned to sixth-century England, is a powerful analysis of such issues as monarchy versus democracy and free will versus determinism, but it is also one of Twain's finest comic novels, still fresh and funny after more than 100 years. In his introduction, M. Thomas Inge shows how A Connecticut Yankee develops from comedy to tragedy and so into a novel that remains a major literary and cultural text for new generations of readers.

The Company We Keep An Ethics of Fiction,"In The Company We Keep, Wayne C. Booth argues for the relocation of ethics to the center of our engagement with literature. But the questions he asks are not confined to morality. Returning ethics to its root sense, Booth proposes that the ethical critic will be interested in any effect on the ethos, the total character or quality of tellers and listeners. Ethical criticism will risk talking about the quality of this particular encounter with this particular work. Yet it will give up the old hope for definitive judgments of ""good"" work and ""bad."" Rather it will be a conversation about many kinds of personal and social goods that fictions can serve or destroy. While not ignoring the consequences for conduct of engaging with powerful stories, it will attend to that more immediate topic, What happens to us as we read? Who am I, during the hours of reading or listening? What is the quality of the life I lead in the company of these would-be friends? Through a wide variety of periods and genres and scores of particular works, Booth pursues various metaphors for such engagements: ""friendship with books,"" ""the exchange of gifts,"" ""the colonizing of worlds,"" ""the constitution of commonwealths."" He concludes with extended explorations of the ethical powers and potential dangers of works by Rabelais, D. H. Lawrence, Jane Austen, and Mark Twain.",['Wayne C.

Up from Methodism,"In 1926, while a reporter for the New York Herald Tribune, Herbert Asbury, great-great-nephew of Francis Asbury, the first American Bishop of the Methodist Church, submitted a chapter of his profane work-in-progress, an almost spiteful memoir of his boyhood in the Ozark town of Farmington, Missouri, to H.L Mencken's American Mercury magazine. Mencken published ""Hatrack,"" the story of the town's prostitute, in the April issue. The Mercury was then banned in Boston at the incitement of J. Frank Chase, the head of the New England Watch and Ward Society, who called the story ""bad, vile, raw stuff."" Mencken was arrested selling the magazine to Chase on Boston Common in a stunt designed to provoke the free-speech trials that followed. In its restrained, but unrelenting attack on religious bigotry, irrationality, and hypocrisy, the book that was published soon thereafter retains its transgressive power today. Its taunting title, playing on Booker T. Washington's early-century bestseller Up from Slavery, gives an idea of what Asbury thought he had escaped. In his mocking humor and plain-spun language, used to evoke a bygone South suffocating in its fear of pleasure and damnation, Asbury reveals his debt to another son of Missouri, Mark Twain.",['Herbert Asbury'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=FgtJswEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=FgtJswEACAAJ&dq=Up+from+Methodism&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Basic Books,2003-12-30,http://books.google.nl/books?id=FgtJswEACAAJ&dq=Up+from+Methodism&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Biography & Autobiography'],1.0
The Last Empire: Essays 1992-2000,"Like his National Book Award—winning United States, Gore Vidal’s scintillating ninth collection, The Last Empire, affirms his reputation as our most provocative critic and observer of the modern American scene. In the essays collected here, Vidal brings his keen intellect, experience, and razor-edged wit to bear on an astonishing range of subjects. From his celebrated profiles of Clare Boothe Luce and Charles Lindbergh and his controversial essay about the Bill of Rights–which sparked an extended correspondence with convicted Oklahoma City Bomber Timothy McVeigh–to his provocative analyses of literary icons such as John Updike and Mark Twain and his trenchant observations about terrorism, civil liberties, the CIA, Al Gore, Tony Blair, and the Clintons, Vidal weaves a rich tapestry of personal anecdote, critical insight, and historical detail.

Following the equator: A journey around the world (The writings of Mark Twain),"Samuel Langhorne Clemens (1835–1910), more commonly known under the pen name Mark Twain, was an American writer, lecturer, publisher and entrepreneur most famous for his novels “The Adventures of Tom Sawyer” (1876) and “The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn” (1884). First published in 1897, Twain's travel book “Following the Equator - A Journey Around the World” chronicles his 1895 tour of the British Empire when he was 60 years old. Fundamentally a social commentary, it is critical of what Twain considered England's oppressive imperialism and the racism that existed inside the empire. Other notable works by this author include: “The Gilded Age: A Tale of Today” (1873) and “The Prince and the Pauper” (1881). Read & Co.

The Complete Short Stories of Mark Twain,"For deft plotting, riotous inventiveness, unforgettable characters, and language that brilliantly captures the lively rhythms of American speech, no American writer comes close to Mark Twain. This sparkling anthology covers the entire span of Twain’s inimitable yarn-spinning, from his early broad comedy to the biting satire of his later years. Every one of his sixty stories is here: ranging from the frontier humor of “The Celebrated Jumping Frog of Calaveras County,” to the bitter vision of humankind in “The Man That Corrupted Hadleyburg,” to the delightful hilarity of “Is He Living or Is He Dead?” Surging with Twain’s ebullient wit and penetrating insight into the follies of human nature, this volume is a vibrant summation of the career of–in the words of H.

A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court,"When Connecticut mechanic and foreman Hank Morgan is knocked unconscious, he wakes not to the familiar scenes of nineteenth-century America but to the bewildering sights and sounds of sixth-century Camelot. Although confused at first and quickly imprisoned, he soon realises that his knowledge of the future can transform his fate. Correctly predicting a solar eclipse from inside his prison cell, Morgan terrifies the people of England into releasing him and swiftly establishes himself as the most powerful magician in the land, stronger than Merlin and greatly admired by Arthur himself. But the Connecticut Yankee wishes for more than simply a place at the Round Table. Soon, he begins a far greater struggle: to bring American democratic ideals to Old England. Complex and fascinating, A Connecticut Yankee is a darkly comic consideration of the nature of human nature and society.

Have I Ever Lied To You? (Political Humor),"“A delightful and entertaining book about one of America’s greatest humorists.”—Seth Meyers This “absorbing, illuminating” (Jon Meacham) biography of the legendary political humorist reveals the life behind his must-read Washington Post columns, featuring never-before-published photos, documents, and interviews. Before Jon Stewart, Stephen Colbert, Trevor Noah, and Doonesbury, there was Art Buchwald. For more than fifty years, from 1949 to 2006, Art Buchwald’s Pulitzer Prize–winning column of political satire and biting wit made him one of the most widely read American humorists and a popular player in the Washington world of Ethel and Ted Kennedy, Ben Bradlee, and Katharine Graham. Dean Acheson, former U.S. Secretary of State, called Buchwald the “greatest satirist in the English language since Pope and Swift.” Drawing on Buchwald’s most memorable columns and unpublished correspondence with other famous people, Funny Business shows how Art Buchwald became an American original. Like Mark Twain, Dorothy Parker, and James Thurber, he satirized political scoundrels, lampooned the powerful, and “worshipped the quicksand” that ten presidents walked on, as Buchwald joked. “The key to Buchwald’s style of humor, he once stated, was to “treat light subjects seriously and serious subjects lightly.” But there was a darker, more serious side to Art Buchwald. A childhood spent in foster homes taught him to see comedy as a refuge. Buchwald also struggled with depression, a secret he kept from the public for nearly thirty years. This revealing book is studded with stories of Buchwald’s friendships with Humphrey Bogart, John Steinbeck, Irwin Shaw, William Styron, Erma Bombeck, Frank Sinatra, Adam West (""Batman""), Robert Frost, and others. Throughout his career, Buchwald wrote about such historical events as the Vietnam War, the assassinations of John and Robert Kennedy, Watergate, and the 9/11 terrorist attack. Featured here are stories of Buchwald’s nonstop one-liners, known in his day as “Buchshots.” Entertaining and absorbing, Funny Business looks back on Buchwald’s brilliant gift for humor and satire, which will once again bring readers a comedic respite from troublesome times.",['Michael Hill'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=eLlBEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=eLlBEAAAQBAJ&pg=PA252&dq=Have+I+Ever+Lied+To+You%3F+(Political+Humor)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Random House,2022-06-07,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=eLlBEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Biography & Autobiography'],
What social classes owe to each other (The Freeman),"This collection seeks to place Pudd’nhead Wilson—a neglected, textually fragmented work of Mark Twain’s—in the context of contemporary critical approaches to literary studies. The editors’ introduction argues the virtues of using Pudd’nhead Wilson as a teaching text, a case study in many of the issues presently occupying literary criticism: issues of history and the uses of history, of canon formation, of textual problematics, and finally of race, class, and gender. In a variety of ways the essays build arguments out of, not in spite of, the anomalies, inconsistencies, and dead ends in the text itself. Such wrinkles and gaps, the authors find, are the symptoms of an inconclusive, even evasive, but culturally illuminating struggle to confront and resolve difficult questions bearing on race and sex. Such fresh, intellectually enriching perspectives on the novel arise directly from the broad-based interdisciplinary foundations provided by the participating scholars. Drawing on a wide variety of critical methodologies, the essays place the novel in ways that illuminate the world in which it was produced and that further promise to stimulate further study.

River Rats,"“Calling to mind such widely disparate writers as Mark Twain, Andre Norton and Peter Dickinson, Stevermer paints a realistic ruin of society.” —Publishers Weekly The award-winning author of the Scholarly Magic series delivers the thrilling adventure of a crew of young kids working their way through a post-apocalyptic world on a steamboat they call home . . . No one knows for sure what caused the Flash. They just know that nothing has been the same since. Cities have been destroyed by pestilence, riots, and fires. The paddleboat River Rat, once a museum, was turned into an orphanage. But a dangerous storm forced the children to flee with the boat to safer waters, making it theirs for good. Since then, Tomcat, Toby, Esteban, Lindy, Spike, and Jake have traveled, bartered, and performed their way up and down the Mississippi River. One rule that has served them well: no passengers. But after watching a man on shore being pursued by a vicious pack of locals, the group has no choice but to save him. At every stop, the boat is met by the man’s tireless hunters. They want what the fugitive knows: the location of a bunker filled with guns. A currency more valuable than gold . . . and one that the crew of the River Rat might well pay for—with their lives. “An unusual, compelling futuristic novel . . . wry, sharp, lively, and perceptive.” —The Horn Book (starred review) “Too good to miss.” —Booklist An ALA Best Book for Young Adults A New York Public Library Book for the Teen Age",['Caroline Stevermer'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ScNZEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=ScNZEAAAQBAJ&pg=PP1&dq=River+Rats&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Open Road Media,2022-03-15,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=ScNZEAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Young Adult Fiction'],

A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (Mark Twain Library),"Hank Morgan awakens one morning to find he has been transported from nineteenth-century New England to sixth-century England and the reign of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table. Morgan brings to King Arthur’s utopian court the ingenuity of the future, resulting in a culture clash that is at once satiric, anarchic, and darkly comic. Critically deemed one of Twain’s finest and most caustic works, A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur’s Court is both a delightfully entertaining story and a disturbing analysis of the efficacy of government, the benefits of progress, and the dissolution of social mores.

My summer in a garden,"Oft quoted but seldom credited,Charles Dudley Warner’s My Summer in a Garden is a classic of American garden writing and was a seminal early work in the then fledgling genre of American nature writing. Warner—prominent in his day as a writer and newspaper editor—was a dedicated amateur gardener who shared with Mark Twain, his close friend and neighbor, a sense of humor that remains deliciously fresh today. In monthly dispatches, Warner chronicles his travails in the garden, where he and his cat, Calvin, seek to ward off a stream of interlopers, from the neighbors’ huge-hoofed cows and thieving children, to the reviled, though “propagatious,” pusley weed. To read Warner is to join him on his rounds of his beloved vegetable patch, to feel the sun on his sore back, the hoe in his blistered hands, and yet, like him, never to lose sight of “the philosophical implications of contact with the earth, and companionship with gently growing things.” This Modern Library edition is published with an extensive new Introduction by Allan Gurganus, author of Oldest Living Confederate Widow Tells All and The Practical Heart.",['Charles Dudley Warner'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=nrdPEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=nrdPEAAAQBAJ&dq=My+summer+in+a+garden&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Modern Library,2002-02-19,http://books.google.com/books?id=nrdPEAAAQBAJ&dq=My+summer+in+a+garden&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Gardening'],2.0

A Tramp Abroad,"Twain's account of travelling in Europe, A TRAMP ABROAD (1880), sparkles with the author's shrewd observations and highly opinionated comments on Old World culture, and showcases his unparalleled ability to integrate humorous sketches, autobiographical tidbits, and historical anecdotes in a consistently entertaining narrative. Cast in the form of a walking tour through Germany, Switzerland, France and Italy, A TRAMP ABROAD includes among its adventures a voyage by raft down the Neckar and an ascent of Mount Blanc by telescope, as well as the author's attempts to study art - a wholly imagined activity Twain 'authenticated' with his own wonderfully primitive pictures included in this volume.

Redeye - A Western,"This New York Times Notable Book is a quirky tale of the Old West from the author of The Bible Salesman, “a master of comic timing” (Richmond Times-Dispatch). “A Hollywood pitchman might call Redeye Eudora Welty meets Mark Twain,” says the New York Times Book Review about Clyde Edgerton’s “small gem of a novel,” a witty adventure set on the nineteenth-century frontier. “A rollicking tale . . . The cliff dwellings of southwest Colorado attract a motley crew of explorers in 1892, each with a personal agenda. Abel Merriwether, a local rancher and amateur archaeologist, wants to explore and protect the site; Andrew Collier, an Englishman, wants to write about it; Billy Blankenship, a local businessman, wants to develop it for tourism; Bishop Thorpe, a Mormon saint, hopes to find proof that Jesus visited there 2000 years before; and Cobb Pittman, a drifter with a red-eyed dog, seeks revenge on Thorpe for the Mountain Meadows Massacre of 1875. How this diverse bunch converges for an ill-fated tour of the site is unforgettable.

In this exceptional memoir, the man himself tells the story of his remarkable life and describes the people, events, and ideas that shaped it. Moving backward and forward across time, he writes about the many strands of his experience: his passion for travel; his lifelong infatuation with literature, music, and painting; his adventures in politics; and the hard work, headaches, and rewards of the writing life. Here at last is the real James Michener: plainspoken, wise, and enormously sympathetic, a man who could truly say, “The world is my home.” BONUS: This edition includes an excerpt from James A. Michener's Hawaii. Praise for The World Is My Home “Michener’s own life makes one of his most engaging tales—a classic American success story.”—Entertainment Weekly “The Michener saga is as full of twists as any of his monumental works. . . . His output, his political interests, his patriotic service, his diligence, and the breadth of his readership are matched only by the great nineteenth-century writers whose works he devoured as he grew up—Dickens, Balzac, Mark Twain.”—Chicago Tribune “There are splendid yarns about [Michener’s] wartime doings in the South Pacific. There are hilarious cautionary tales about his service on government commissions. There are wonderful inside stories from the publishing business. And always there is Michener himself—analyzing his own character, assessing himself as a writer, chronicling his intellectual life, giving advice to young writers.”—The Plain Dealer “A sweepingly interesting life . . . Whether he’s having an epiphany over a campout in New Guinea with head-hunting cannibals or getting politically charged by the melodrama of great opera, James A.

The Fools In Town Are On Our Side,"""Hain't we got all the fools in town on our side? And ain't that a big enough majority in any town?"" -- Mark Twain Ross Thomas chose the quotation from Huckleberry Finn as the text of his post World War II story as well as for the title. When Lucifer Dye is released from three months in a Hong Kong prison, debriefed, handed a false passport, a new wardrobe and a $20,000 check, his haughty control makes it clear that Dye's career with his country has been permanently terminated. But a good agent is always in demand, and just a few hours later Dye is being interviewed for a highly ingenious position. Victor Orcutt, although a not very good imitation of a British pre-war gent, has creative talents of his own. He has his sights a small southern city, with the ordinary run-of-the-mill corruption one would expect in such a place. The canny Orcott knows there's no profit in that .

Mark Twain : Historical Romances : Prince & the Pauper / Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court / Personal Recollections of Joan of Arc (Library of America),"In the three novels collected in this Library of America volume, Mark Twain turned his comic genius to a period that fascinated and repelled him in equal measure: medieval and Renaissance Europe. This lost world of stately pomp and unspeakable cruelty, artistic splendor and abysmal ignorance—the seeming opposite of brashly optimistic, commercial, democratic nineteenth-century America—engaged Twain’s imagination, inspiring a children’s classic, and astonishing fantasy of comedy and violence, and an unusual fictional biography. Twain drew on his fascination with impersonation and the theme of the double in The Prince and the Pauper (1882), which brilliantly uses the device of identical boys from opposite ends of the social hierarchy to evoke the tumultuous contrasts of Henry VIII’s England. As the pauper Tom Canty is raised to the throne, while the rightful heir is cast out among thieves and beggars, Twain sustains one of his most compelling narratives. A perennial children’s favorite, the novel brings an impassioned American point of view to the injustices of traditional European society. A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur’s Court (1889) finds Twain in high satiric form. When hard-headed Yankee mechanic Hank Morgan is knocked out in a fight, he wakes up in Camelot in A.D. 528—and finds himself pitted against the medieval rituals and superstitions of King Arthur and his knights. In a hilarious burlesque of the age of chivalry and of its cult in the nineteenth-century American South, Twain demolishes knighthood’s romantic aura to reveal a brutish, violent society beset by ignorance. But the comic mood gives way to a darker questioning of both ancient and modern society, culminating in an astonishing apocalyptic conclusion that questions both American progress and Yankee “ingenuity” as Camelot is undone by the introduction of advanced technology. “Taking into account . . . her origin, youth, sex, illiteracy, early environment, and the obstructing conditions under which she exploited her high gifts and made her conquest in the field and before the courts that tried her for her life—she is easily and by far the most extraordinary person the human race has ever known.” So Twain wrote of the heroine of Personal Recollections of Joan of Arc (1896), his most elaborate work of historical reconstruction. A respectful and richly detailed chronicle, by turns admiring and indignant, Joan of Arc opens a fascinating window onto the moral imagination of America’s greatest comic writer. LIBRARY OF AMERICA is an independent nonprofit cultural organization founded in 1979 to preserve our nation’s literary heritage by publishing, and keeping permanently in print, America’s best and most significant writing.

James Fenimore Cooper,"James Fenimore Cooper (1789–1851) invented the key forms of American fiction—the Western, the sea tale, the Revolutionary War romance. Furthermore, Cooper turned novel writing from a polite diversion into a paying career. He influenced Herman Melville, Richard Henry Dana, Jr., Francis Parkman, and even Mark Twain—who felt the need to flagellate Cooper for his “literary offenses.” His novels mark the starting point for any history of our environmental conscience. Far from complicit in the cleansings of Native Americans that characterized the era, Cooper’s fictions traced native losses to their economic sources. Perhaps no other American writer stands in greater need of a major reevaluation than Cooper. This is the first treatment of Cooper’s life to be based on full access to his family papers. Cooper’s life, as Franklin relates it, is the story of how, in literature and countless other endeavors, Americans in his period sought to solidify their political and cultural economic independence from Britain and, as the Revolutionary generation died, stipulate what the maturing republic was to become. The first of two volumes, James Fenimore Cooper: The Early Years covers Cooper’s life from his boyhood up to 1826, when, at the age of thirty-six, he left with his wife and five children for Europe.",['Wayne Franklin'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1O68047d3OgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=1O68047d3OgC&printsec=frontcover&dq=James+Fenimore+Cooper&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Yale University Press,2008-10-01,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=1O68047d3OgC&source=gbs_api,['Biography & Autobiography'],

The U.N.C.L.E. Tribute Book: Unofficial and Unauthorized-The Complete Story!!! : America's Favorite TV Spies!,"This book recovers a major nineteenth-century literary figure, the American Claimant. For over a century, claimants offered a compelling way to understand cultural difference across the Anglophone Atlantic, especially between Britain and the United States. They also formed a political talisman, invoked against slavery and segregation, or privileges of gender and class. Later, claimants were exported to South Africa, becoming the fictional form for explaining black students who acquired American degrees. American Claimants traces the figure back to lost-heir romance, and explores its uses. These encompassed real, imagined, and textual ideas of inheritance, for writers and editors, and also for missionaries, artists, and students. The claimant dramatized tensions between tradition and change, or questions of exclusion and power: it offered ways of seeing activism, education, sculpture, and dress. The premise for dozens of novels and plays, a trope, a joke, even the basis for real claims: claimants matter in theatre history and periodical studies, they touch on literary marketing and reprinting, and they illuminate some unexpected texts. These range from Our American Cousin to Bleak House, Little Lord Fauntleroy to Frederick Douglass' Paper; writers discussed include Frances Trollope, Julia Griffiths, Alexander Crummell, John Dube, James McCune Smith, Nathaniel Hawthorne, and Mark Twain. The focus on claimants yields remarkable finds: new faces, fresh angles, a lost column, and a forgotten theatrical genre. It reveals the pervasiveness of this form, and its centrality in imagining cultural contact and exchange.",['Sarah Meer'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=v3XnDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=v3XnDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+U.N.C.L.E.+Tribute+Book:+Unofficial+and+Unauthorized-The+Complete+Story!!!+:+America%27s+Favorite+TV+Spies!&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Oxford University Press,2020-05-14,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=v3XnDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Literary Criticism'],
Low man on a totem pole,"H Allen Smith has sometimes been referred to as ""the best-selling humorist since Mark Twain"". Considering that he wrote against the likes of James Thurber, Robert Benchley, and S. J. Perelman, that's quite a statement. And probably true. He sold a million copies of each of his first several books, starting with Low Man on a Totem Pole. In this book, which might be called a fraction of his memoirs (Mr. Smith claimed he could have filled twenty), he recounts the high points of his life amid the human race -- a race he appreciated and observed with a keen nose for the humor hiding in the most unexpected places. Here is a panorama of unlikely people who really existed, of inconceivable things that actually happened, of the commonplace rarities of our frenzied epoch. Among others, there is the newspaperman who suffered under the delusion that Herbert Hoover had bladders on his feet: the man who thoughtfully and perpetually bounced turtle eggs on a bar: a deaf dentist who trained his dog to act as his receptionist; a child prodigy who couldn't talk any too well, but appeared to know more about swing music than the head usher at the Paramount Theater -- all these are part of Mr. Smith's life and times.",['H Allen Smith'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=X19QCgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=X19QCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA1&dq=Low+man+on+a+totem+pole&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,eNet Press,2015-07-27,http://books.google.com/books?id=X19QCgAAQBAJ&dq=Low+man+on+a+totem+pole&hl=&source=gbs_api,,

Mark and Livy the Love Story of Mark Twain and the Woman Who Almost Tamed Him,"Olivia Langdon Clemens was not only the love of Mark Twain's life and the mother of his children, she was also his editor, muse, critic and trusted advisor. She read his letters and speeches. He relied on her judgment on his writing, and readily admitted that she not only edited his work, but also edited his public persona.Until now, little has been known about Livy's crucial place in Twain's life. In Resa Willis's affecting and fascinating biography, we meet a dignified, optimistic women who married young, raised three sons and a daughter, endured myriad health problems and money woes and who faithfully traipsed all over the world with Twain--Africa, Europe, Asia--while battling his moodiness and her frailty.Twain adored her. A hard-drinking dreamer with an insatiable wanderlust, he needed someone to tame him. It was Livy who encouraged him to finish his autobiography even through the last stages of her illness. When she died in 1904, Twain's zest for life and writing was gone. He died six years later. A triumph of the biographer's art, Mark and Livy presents the fullest picture yet of one of the most influential women in American letters.",['Resa Willis'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=FlJx9qSBcJMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=FlJx9qSBcJMC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Mark+and+Livy+the+Love+Story+of+Mark+Twain+and+the+Woman+Who+Almost+Tamed+Him&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Routledge,2004-06-01,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=FlJx9qSBcJMC&source=gbs_api,['Biography & Autobiography'],

The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (Courage Literary Classics),"Not that Hemingway was correct, but he did write in 1935: ""All modern American literature comes from one book by Mark Twain called Huckleberry Finn;” unless we are to interpret the adjective 'modern' as 'unadorned.' But Hemingway's remark somehow points to the importance of Mark Twain's breezy, fresh, and straight-forward style.Huckleberry Finn is a poor child whose only family is “Pap” —his abusive drunk father. Huck runs away, and meets Jim, a slave, who is also running away. So, here we have from the very beginning of the novel, two heavy topics: child abuse and slavery. Although Mark Twain has been criticized for his stereotypical presentation Jim, he —a white author— imbues Jim with much humanity in an era in which slaves were considered sub-human. Had any other writer dare do such a thing? Dis anyone else besides Jane Austen write about the slave trade? It took courage to deal with such themes.

Queer Cowboys: And Other Erotic Male Friendships in Nineteenth-Century American Literature,"Why do the earliest representations of cowboy-figures symbolizing the highest ideals of manhood in American culture exclude male-female desire while promoting homosocial and homoerotic bonds? Evidence from the best-known Western writers and artists of the post-Civil War period - Owen Wister, Mark Twain, Frederic Remington, George Catlin - as well as now-forgotten writers, illustrators, and photographers, suggest that in the period before the word 'homosexual' and its synonyms were invented, same-sex intimacy and erotic admiration were key aspects of a masculine code. These males-only clubs of journalists, cowboys, miners, Indian vaqueros defined themselves by excluding femininity and the cloying ills of domesticity, while embracing what Roosevelt called 'strenuous living' with other bachelors in the relative 'purity' of wilderness conditions. Queer Cowboys recovers this forgotten culture of exclusively masculine, sometimes erotic, and often intimate camaraderie in fiction, photographs, illustrations, song lyrics, historical ephemera, and theatrical performances.",['C.

Mark Twain & the Starchy Boys,"Mark Twain, the American comic genius who portrayed, named, and in part exemplified America’s “Gilded Age,” comes alive in Justin Kaplan’s extraordinary biography. With brilliant immediacy, Mr. Clemens and Mark Twain brings to life a towering literary figure whose dual persona symbolized the emerging American conflict between down-to-earth morality and freewheeling ambition. As Mark Twain, he was the Mississippi riverboat pilot, the satirist with a fiery hatred of pretension, and the author of such classics as Tom Sawyer andHuckleberry Finn. As Mr. Clemens, he was the star who married an heiress, built a palatial estate, threw away fortunes on harebrained financial schemes, and lived the extravagant life that Mark Twain despised. Kaplan effectively portrays the triumphant-tragic man whose achievements and failures, laughter and anger, reflect a crucial generation in our past as well as his own dark, divided, and remarkably contemporary spirit. Mr. Clemens and Mark Twain brilliantly conveys this towering literary figure who was himself a symbol of the peculiarly American conflict between moral scrutiny and the drive to succeed. Mr. Clemens lived the Gilded Life that Mark Twain despised. The merging and fragmenting of these and other identities, as the biography unfolds, results in a magnificent projection of the whole man; the great comic spirit; and the exuberant, tragic human being, who, his friend William Dean Howells said, was “sole, incomparable, the Lincoln of our literature.”",['Justin Kaplan'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=lj1Rc68iZ0YC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=lj1Rc68iZ0YC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Mark+Twain&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Simon and Schuster,2008-06-30,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=lj1Rc68iZ0YC&source=gbs_api,['Biography & Autobiography'],3.0

TESLA MAN OUT OF TIME,"In this “informative and delightful” (American Scientist) biography, Margaret Cheney explores the brilliant and prescient mind of Nikola Tesla, one of the twentieth century’s greatest scientists and inventors. In Tesla: Man Out of Time, Margaret Cheney explores the brilliant and prescient mind of one of the twentieth century's greatest scientists and inventors. Called a madman by his enemies, a genius by others, and an enigma by nearly everyone, Nikola Tesla was, without a doubt, a trailblazing inventor who created astonishing, sometimes world-transforming devices that were virtually without theoretical precedent. Tesla not only discovered the rotating magnetic field -- the basis of most alternating-current machinery -- but also introduced us to the fundamentals of robotics, computers, and missile science. Almost supernaturally gifted, unfailingly flamboyant and neurotic, Tesla was troubled by an array of compulsions and phobias and was fond of extravagant, visionary experimentations. He was also a popular man-about-town, admired by men as diverse as Mark Twain and George Westinghouse, and adored by scores of society beauties. From Tesla's childhood in Yugoslavia to his death in New York in the 1940s, Cheney paints a compelling human portrait and chronicles a lifetime of discoveries that radically altered -- and continue to alter -- the world in which we live. Tesla: Man Out of Time is an in-depth look at the seminal accomplishments of a scientific wizard and a thoughtful examination of the obsessions and eccentricities of the man behind the science.",['Margaret Cheney'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=HIuK7iLO9zgC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=HIuK7iLO9zgC&printsec=frontcover&dq=TESLA+MAN+OUT+OF+TIME&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Simon and Schuster,2011-11-08,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=HIuK7iLO9zgC&source=gbs_api,['Biography & Autobiography'],7.0

Understanding & Negotiating Turnkey Epc,"Mark Twain once derided the Book of Mormon as ""chloroform in print."" Long and complicated, written in the language of the King James version of the Bible, it boggles the minds of many. Yet it is unquestionably one of the most influential books ever written. With over 140 million copies in print, it is a central text of one of the largest and fastest-growing faiths in the world. And, Grant Hardy shows, it's far from the coma-inducing doorstop caricatured by Twain. In Understanding the Book of Mormon, Hardy offers the first comprehensive analysis of the work's narrative structure in its 180 year history. Unlike virtually all other recent world scriptures, the Book of Mormon presents itself as an integrated narrative rather than a series of doctrinal expositions, moral injunctions, or devotional hymns. Hardy takes readers through its characters, events, and ideas, as he explores the story and its messages. He identifies the book's literary techniques, such as characterization, embedded documents, allusions, and parallel narratives. Whether Joseph Smith is regarded as author or translator, it's noteworthy that he never speaks in his own voice; rather, he mediates nearly everything through the narrators Nephi, Mormon, and Moroni. Hardy shows how each has a distinctive voice, and all are woven into an integral whole. As with any scripture, the contending views of the Book of Mormon can seem irreconcilable.

Mark Twain : A Biography (Greenwood Biographies),"Samuel Clemens lived 75 years, 50 under the pseudonym Mark Twain. His youth could be characterized as sometimes mischievous, his older years as generally eccentric and his writing as always provocative. Twain left a literary canon of nearly 50 books, hundreds of short stories and essays, and a veritable treasury of quotable epigrams. While his words and his works have stood up to the test of time, knowing the man behind the persona, and understanding what inspired and influenced the writer, is crucial to fully appreciating the contributions Twain made to American literature. By skillfully weaving together strands of history with his personal story, this authoritative biography helps readers come to more fully understand the man and his enduring legacy. Starting with a chapter on Clemens' boyhood, readers are treated to a very personal view of Twain's early life. Twain's adult life is chronicled with five expertly developed chapters that explore his early professional years from printer to pilot, his travels westward and abroad, his gilded years with his beloved wife Livy, and his final years of widowhood and decline. This engaging biography also delves into the enduring impact of Twain's creative voice and his unique blend of humor with social commentary that not only entertained but also challenged thinking and changed the literary landscape forever. This biography draws from the best of established Twain resources and scholarship, and adds fresh new perspectives from personal letters, original manuscripts, and extended study visits to important places including Twain's study and Quarry Farm. This work is written in a lively style that Twain himself would appreciate and students will enjoy. Researchers hoping to dig deeper into the Twain legacy will benefit from the expertly compiled information and documentation of resources offered here. A chronology, a bibliography and five additional fact-filled appendices, including quotes from Twain, books by Twain, and a rendering of his family tree will help readers get a solid handle on the details as well as the big picture of Mark Twain's life and legacy.",['Connie Ann Kirk'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=UDNpTISRmUQC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=UDNpTISRmUQC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Mark+Twain+:+A+Biography+(Greenwood+Biographies)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,ABC-CLIO,2004-07-30,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=UDNpTISRmUQC&source=gbs_api,['Literary Criticism'],

Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer among the Indians: And Other Unfinished Stories (Mark Twain Library),"o Includes the authoritative texts for eleven pieces written between 1868 and 1902 o Publishes, for the first time, the complete text of ""Villagers of 1840-3,"" Mark Twain's astounding feat of memory o Features a biographical directory and notes that reflect extensive new research on Mark Twain's early life in Missouri Throughout his career, Mark Twain frequently turned for inspiration to memories of his youth in the Mississippi River town of Hannibal, Missouri. What has come to be known as the Matter of Hannibal inspired two of his most famous books, Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn, and provided the basis for the eleven pieces reprinted here. Most of these selections (eight of them fiction and three of them autobiographical) were never completed, and all were left unpublished. Written between 1868 and 1902, they include a diverse assortment of adventures, satires, and reminiscences in which the characters of his own childhood and of his best-loved fiction, particularly Huck Finn and Tom Sawyer, come alive again. The autobiographical recollections culminate in an astounding feat of memory titled ""Villagers of 1840-3"" in which the author, writing for himself alone at the age of sixty-one, recalls with humor and pathos the characters of some one hundred and fifty people from his childhood. Accompanied by notes that reflect extensive new research on Mark Twain's early life in Missouri, the selections in this volume offer a revealing view of Mark Twain's varied and repeated attempts to give literary expression to the Matter of Hannibal.",['Mark Twain'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=6hu1ojjzXYMC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=6hu1ojjzXYMC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Huck+Finn+and+Tom+Sawyer+among+the+Indians:+And+Other+Unfinished+Stories+(Mark+Twain+Library)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Univ of California Press,2011-06,http://books.google.com/books?id=6hu1ojjzXYMC&dq=Huck+Finn+and+Tom+Sawyer+among+the+Indians:+And+Other+Unfinished+Stories+(Mark+Twain+Library)&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Literary Criticism'],2.0

The Ordways,"“Good writing is rare enough. Storytelling is an even rarer skill. A genuinely comic vision is beyond price. The Ordways has all three.” —Time On the annual graveyard-working day in Clarksville, Texas, families come from all over East Texas to pay respects to their loved ones. The Ordways are one such clan, and in this eloquent and original novel, our narrator recounts the story of how he and his kin arrived in this magical land where the South meets the West. The tale begins with his great-grandfather, Thomas Ordway, who lost his sight at the Battle of Shiloh and vowed to quit Tennessee forever. He crossed the Red River into Texas and stopped on the edge of the featureless prairie, a landscape too mystifying even for a sightless man. Years later, the narrator’s grandfather, Sam Ordway, was forced to leave the forest behind when his three-year-old son, Ned, was kidnapped by a neighbor. Sam scoured the vast state of Texas in search of Ned but never found the boy. The mystery of what happened to him and what his long-hoped-for return might mean to the Ordways brings William Humphrey’s brilliant second novel to its rich and satisfying conclusion. A masterful blend of comedy, tragedy, and history, The Ordways is great American fiction in the tradition of William Faulkner and Mark Twain.

Mark Twain: A Biography,"Mark Twain, the American comic genius who portrayed, named, and in part exemplified America’s “Gilded Age,” comes alive in Justin Kaplan’s extraordinary biography. With brilliant immediacy, Mr. Clemens and Mark Twain brings to life a towering literary figure whose dual persona symbolized the emerging American conflict between down-to-earth morality and freewheeling ambition. As Mark Twain, he was the Mississippi riverboat pilot, the satirist with a fiery hatred of pretension, and the author of such classics as Tom Sawyer andHuckleberry Finn. As Mr. Clemens, he was the star who married an heiress, built a palatial estate, threw away fortunes on harebrained financial schemes, and lived the extravagant life that Mark Twain despised. Kaplan effectively portrays the triumphant-tragic man whose achievements and failures, laughter and anger, reflect a crucial generation in our past as well as his own dark, divided, and remarkably contemporary spirit. Mr. Clemens and Mark Twain brilliantly conveys this towering literary figure who was himself a symbol of the peculiarly American conflict between moral scrutiny and the drive to succeed. Mr. Clemens lived the Gilded Life that Mark Twain despised. The merging and fragmenting of these and other identities, as the biography unfolds, results in a magnificent projection of the whole man; the great comic spirit; and the exuberant, tragic human being, who, his friend William Dean Howells said, was “sole, incomparable, the Lincoln of our literature.”",['Justin Kaplan'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=lj1Rc68iZ0YC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=lj1Rc68iZ0YC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Mark+Twain:+A+Biography&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Simon and Schuster,2008-06-30,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=lj1Rc68iZ0YC&source=gbs_api,['Biography & Autobiography'],3.0

"My summer in a garden,","Oft quoted but seldom credited,Charles Dudley Warner’s My Summer in a Garden is a classic of American garden writing and was a seminal early work in the then fledgling genre of American nature writing. Warner—prominent in his day as a writer and newspaper editor—was a dedicated amateur gardener who shared with Mark Twain, his close friend and neighbor, a sense of humor that remains deliciously fresh today. In monthly dispatches, Warner chronicles his travails in the garden, where he and his cat, Calvin, seek to ward off a stream of interlopers, from the neighbors’ huge-hoofed cows and thieving children, to the reviled, though “propagatious,” pusley weed. To read Warner is to join him on his rounds of his beloved vegetable patch, to feel the sun on his sore back, the hoe in his blistered hands, and yet, like him, never to lose sight of “the philosophical implications of contact with the earth, and companionship with gently growing things.” This Modern Library edition is published with an extensive new Introduction by Allan Gurganus, author of Oldest Living Confederate Widow Tells All and The Practical Heart.",['Charles Dudley Warner'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=nrdPEAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.com/books?id=nrdPEAAAQBAJ&dq=My+summer+in+a+garden,&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",Modern Library,2002-02-19,"http://books.google.com/books?id=nrdPEAAAQBAJ&dq=My+summer+in+a+garden,&hl=&source=gbs_api",['Gardening'],2.0

Service Breakthroughs: Changing the Rules of the Game,"What Do Citicorp, UPS and Marriott have in common? They are ""breakthrough"" service providers, firms that changed the rules of the game in their respective industries by consistently meeting or exceeding customer needs and expectations. To find out how these companies do it, service management experts James Heskett, Earl Sasser, and Christopher Hart put the question to the chief executive officers of fifteen of America's leading service firms attending a workshop at the Harvard Business School. Breakthrough leaders, they discovered, think very differently about their businesses than do their competitors, in distinct and well-defined ways. Now, in Service Breakthroughs, based upon five years of exhaustive research in fourteen service industries, Heskett, Sasser, and Hart show exactly what enables one or two companies in each industry to constantly set new standards for quality and value that force competitors to adapt or fail. At the heart of breakthrough performance, the authors contend, is a sometimes intuitive but thorough understanding of the ""self-reinforcing service cycle"" that replaces traditional management of ""trade-offs."" The ""cycle"" is a paradigm derived from the research results suggesting direct links between heightened customer satisfaction, increased customer retention, augmented sales and profit, improved quality and productivity, greater service value per unit of cost, improved satisfaction of service providers, increased employee retention, and further heightened customer satisfaction. With detailed examples and dramatic case studies of Mark Twain Bancshares, American Airlines, Florida Power & Light, Federal Express, McDonald's and many other companies, Heskett, Sasser, and Hart show how this self-reinforcing cycle of behavior differentiates breakthrough leaders from their ""merely good"" competitors. The authors describe how breakthrough managers develop counterintuitive, even contrarian, strategic service visions. These companies define their ""service concept"" in terms of results achieved for customers rather than services performed. They target market segments by focusing on psychographics -- how customers think and behave -- instead of demographics. And instead of viewing a service delivery system as a facility where the service is producted and sold, breakthrough firms see it as an opportunity to enhance the quality of the service. These profound differences in thought and action have brought spectacular results. For managers who wish to set the pace in their service industries, Service Breakthroughs will be essential reading.",['James L.

"The Importance of Being Lazy: In Praise of Play, Leisure, and Vacation","The great American fantasy is about leisure: wooded getaways, Caribbean cruises, white-water rafting, thelights of Las Vegas.

Mark Twain's America:,"Mark Twain is an American icon. We now know him as the author of classics, but in his day he was a controversial satirist and public figure who traveled the world and healed post-Civil War America with his tall tales, witty anecdotes, and humorous but insightful novels and stories. Twain's legacy continues to flourish over 100 years after his death. MARK TWAIN'S AMERICA features spectacular examples of Twain memorabilia and period Americana from the unsurpassed collections of the Library of Congress: rare illustrations, vintage photographs, popular and fine prints, period views, caricatures, cartoons, maps, and more. Excerpts from Twain's writings are framed in a lively narrative by author Harry L. Katz. Covering the years between 1850 and 1910, the book gives readers an intimate view of Twain's many roles in life: Mississippi river boat pilot, California gold prospector, ""printer's devil"" at a small-town newspaper, muckraking journalist, novelist, public speaker extraordinaire, our first major celebrity author. Through letters, political cartoons, photographs and more, MARK TWAIN'S AMERICA offers an inside look into Twain's life as well as the literary. social, and political life of America during his time.","['Harry L.

Superstition and Other Essays,"Of all men living and dead, I love Ingersoll most. - Mark TwainCivil War veteran, successful lawyer, persuasive spokesman for the Republican Party, spellbinding orator, and controversial iconoclast, Col. Robert G. Ingersoll (1833-1899) was one of the best-known intellectuals of the 19th century. He rose to national prominence through his gift for oratory, which he publicly displayed on numerous lecture circuit tours. For almost twenty years this dedicated popularizer of progressive thinking and staunch critic of superstition would regularly address huge audiences, opening their minds to ideas that often provoked guarded whispers in private. Ingersoll was a man far ahead of his time, who advocated agnosticism, birth control, voting rights for women, the advancement of science, and civil rights for all races. Though eloquent on a wide variety of topics, he became most famous, and notorious, for his provocative lectures questioning the traditional, Bible-based Christian worldview of the age.In this volume are collected his best-known lectures on religion, the Bible, and related subjects. Included are Why I Am an Agnostic; The Truth; What Is Religion?; Superstition; What Infidels Have Done; What Should You Substitute for the Bible as a Moral Guide?; Crumbling Creeds; The Liberty of Man, Woman, and Child; and Love.This outstanding collection is indispensable for freethinkers, humanists, and open-minded people of all persuasions.",['Robert G.

The Uses of Grammar,"In this second edition of THE USES OF GRAMMAR, Judith Rodby and W. Ross Winterowd develop their successful first edition with new examples, more discussion questions and exercises, and clear explanations of the grammatical principles that teach students to understand grammar conceptually and deeply. The first edition has been completely redesigned visually to enhance learning and retention. Rodby and Winterowd's THE USES OF GRAMMAR 2E is an accessible approach grounded in deep understanding of language acquisition, structure, and even the rhetoric of everyday use. THE USES OF GRAMMAR 2E integrates traditional, structural, and functional concepts with ideas from contemporary linguistics and grammatical study. Rather than simply partition the study of grammar from the bottom up-from the parts to the whole-Rodby and Winterowd employ a unique structure based on the differentiation of FORM and FUNCTION. This structure is framed around three questions: What are the forms in the grammar of American English? How do those forms function in that grammar? How are they used in real-life speaking and writing to achieve specific purposes? Students may learn, for example, how a variety of FORMS (including nouns, pronouns, verbals, and clauses) can all FUNCTION as nominals. This form/function approach ensures that students learn the uses of grammar as both an object of study and as the living text of social interaction. - THE USES OF GRAMMAR thus uses living language to illustrate the practical applications of grammar in our lives. These examples are drawn from a wide variety of sources-newspapers, magazines, books, and the writings of undergraduate students--and from such writers and speakers as Ronald Reagan, Shirley Chisholm, Groucho Marx, Mark Twain, and Jane Addams. Class-tested and refined to be student- and instructor-friendly, THE USES OF GRAMMAR 2E also features ""For Discussion"" sections that enhance students' understanding of the principles covered in the text and encourage classroom discussion. ""Using Grammar"" sections show students how to think about grammar's function in social relations. ""Language Learning"" sections summarize critical concepts. Chapter Previews and Chapter Reviews help students anticipate the new principles, rules, and concepts to follow and reinforce learning. Exercises ask students to rehearse new learning, and Challengers ask them to apply this learning to broader issues or more complex problems. - JUDITH RODBY joined the faculty at California State University, Chico in 1989 after finishing her PhD in the rhetoric, linguistics, and literature program at the University of Southern California. She has been the composition coordinator, writing center director, and coordinator of basic writing. She is currently working primarily in the field of English education and is coordinator for the National Writing Project's National Reading Initiative. She has published in composition, ESL, youth development, and English education. - W. Ross Winterowd was the Bruce R. McElderry Professor Emeritus, University of Southern California, where he founded its PhD program in Rhetoric, Linguistics, and Literature. He authored, coauthored, or edited many essays, reviews, poems, and books, including SEARCHING FOR FAITH: A SKEPTIC'S JOURNEY (2004, Parlor Press), SENIOR CITIZENS WRITING (2007, Parlor Press), THE CULTURE AND POLITICS OF LITERACY (1989, Oxford), and ATTITUDES: SELECTED PROSE AND POETRY (2010, Parlor Press). In 2010, he received the field's highest honor, the Exemplar Award, from the Conference on College Composition and Communication. He passed away in January, 2011, shortly after completing work on THE USES OF GRAMMAR.","['Judith Rodby', 'W.

"A Middle East Mosaic: Fragments of Life, Letters, and History","In times of war and in peace, from the earliest days of the Roman Empire to our own, Westerners have journeyed to the lands of the middle east, bringing back accounts of their adventures and impressions. Yet it was never a one way exchange. From the first Arab embassy to the Vikings in the 9th century to the internet musings of the Taliban, A Middle East Mosaic collects a rich, boisterous literature of cultural exchange. We see the American Revolution through the eyes of a Moroccan Ambassador and the French Revolution through a series of Imperial Ottoman proclamations. We find surprising portraits of Napoleon (""a brigand chief""), TE Lawrence and Ataturk. We learn what George Washington and Machiavelli through t of Turkish politics and hear Flaubert and Thackeray rail against eastern crime and punishment. We peer into Voltaire's business correspondence and follow the footsteps of Mark Twain, Richard Burton, Gertrude Bell and Ibn Battutta, the Marco Polo of the east. Great discoveries are recorded - an Egyptian Ambassador is introduced to electricity and dismisses the spectacle as ""frankish trickery;"" another pronounces the invention of a secure mail system most useful for assignations. We enter the harem with a 16th century organ maker and emerge with Ottoman reform. It was not until the sixteenth century that the first middle eastern rulers entered into diplomatic relations with European rulers, but trade often precede diplomatic relations. Business men from the days of the crusades against Saladin to the oil prospecting of Samuel Cox and his descendents have seen great possibilities in the markets of the middle east. And throughout the centuries we have been united by war. We witness the outbreak of the Crimean war with Karl Marx and enter Egypt with Napoleon. We observe Arab customs with George Patton and visit Baghdad and Cairo with George F. Kennan in the second world war. When Usama bin Ladin rails against ""Jews and crusaders"" occupying the holy land, he is rehearsing a grievance with a long history. This symphony of voices, full of wit and wisdom, spite and wonder, suspicion, befuddlement and occasional insight, is ordered and explained by our foremost living historian of the middle east. The fruit of a lifetime of scholarship and erudition, A Middle East Mosaic is a dazzling capstone to a brilliant career. In a spirited reappraisal of western views of the east and eastern views of the west over the last two thousand years, Bernard Lewis gives us a brilliant over-view of 2,000 years of commerce, diplomacy, war and exploration. This book is a delight, a treasury of stories drawn from letters, diaries and histories, but also from unpublished archives and previously untranslated accounts. Diplomats and interpreters, slaves, soldiers, pilgrims and missionaries, princes and spies, businessmen, doctors and priests all pour forth their stories of the people and events that shaped history. A Middle East Mosaic cannot fail to appeal to anyone with an appetite for history and a curiosity about the vagaries of cultural exchange.",['Bernard Lewis'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=VudI81drMBoC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.com/books?id=VudI81drMBoC&printsec=frontcover&dq=A+Middle+East+Mosaic:+Fragments+of+Life,+Letters,+and+History&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",Modern Library,2007-12-18,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=VudI81drMBoC&source=gbs_api,['History'],

Mary Baker Eddy (Radcliffe Biography Series),"In 1866, a frail, impoverished invalid, middle-aged, widowed and divorced, rose from her bed after a life-threatening fall, asked for her Bible, and took the first steps toward the founding of the Christian Science Church. Four decades later, she was revered as their leader by thousands of churches in the U.S. and Europe, had founded a national newspaper, and had become probably the most powerful woman in America.Who was this astonishing woman, the mother of the Mother Church? How did she prepare for her illustrious career during her years of obscurity, and what was her inspiration for the healing practices and doctrine of Christian Science? Gillian Gill, a non-Christian Science Scientist scholar, who managed to win unparalleled access to the Church archives, offers here an entirely new look at Mary Baker Eddy.For the first time readers will see the extraordinary leadership skills exercised by Mrs. Eddy despite the repressive forces facing women in her time. For the first time we learn the full story of the bizarre attack on Mrs. Eddy by Joseph Pulitzer and his New York World—alleging that she was at least senile and possibly not even alive. In this enthralling biography, we rediscover Mary Baker Eddy as a radical Christian thinker, pioneer in the recognition of mind/body connections, survivor of scandal, and target of both admiration and scorn from such eminent contemporaries as Mark Twain. Gillian Gill's sense of drama, her critical acumen, and her delicious wit bring to life a brilliant religious leader whose message has new meaning in our time.",['Gill Gillian'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=3s6n4Z-I0sUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=3s6n4Z-I0sUC&q=Mary+Baker+Eddy+(Radcliffe+Biography+Series)&dq=Mary+Baker+Eddy+(Radcliffe+Biography+Series)&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Da Capo Press,1999-09-24,http://books.google.nl/books?id=3s6n4Z-I0sUC&dq=Mary+Baker+Eddy+(Radcliffe+Biography+Series)&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Biography & Autobiography'],
Psychoanalytic Responses to Childrens Literature,"With the growing emphasis on theory in literary studies, psychoanalytic criticism is making notable contributions to literary interpretation. Sixteen chapters in this work explore the psychological subtexts of such important children's books as Carlo Collodi's Pinocchio, Roald Dahl's James and the Giant Peach, Kenneth Grahame's The Wind in the Willows, Louise Fitzhugh's Harriet the Spy, Mark Twain's The Prince and the Pauper, and E.B. White's Charlotte's Web. Drawing on the ideas of such psychoanalytic theorists as Sigmund Freud, Alice Miller, D.W. Winnicott and Jacques Lacan, it analyzes the psychological development of characters, examines reader responses, and studies the lives of authors and illustrators such as Beatrix Potter and Jessie Willcox Smith.","['Lucy Rollin', 'Mark I.

Sir Gibbie,"Unique features of this edition of Sir Gibbie:*** Eleven original illustrations by artist Carrie Stout*** English translations of all Scots dialogue, by David Jack, side-by-side with the original text*** Introduction by best-selling author Michael Phillips GEORGE MACDONALD (1824-1905), Scottish poet, novelist, and minister, was a mentor to Lewis Carroll, friend of Mark Twain, and an inspiration to countless Christians. C.S. Lewis, author of THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA,said of MacDonald, ""I know hardly any other writer who seems to be closer, or more continually close, to the Spirit of Christ Himself."" G.K. Chesterton wrote, ""If we test the matter of originality of attitude, George MacDonald was one of the three of four greatest men of the 19th century.""The twelve novels MacDonald set in his homeland make frequent use of Scots dialogue, which has posed a problem for many would-be readers. This new edition of SIR GIBBIE, book three in the translation series, provides the complete original text, but places English side-by-side with the Scots. Also featured is an introduction by renowned MacDonald authority and best-selling author Michael Phillips.In his preface, translator David Jack identifies two of SIR GIBBIE's most striking features: its ""ineluctable fairy-tale quality"" and ""the purity of its gospel message."" The hero of the novel, Gibbie himself, he describes as belonging to a world of marvels, and argues that ""throughout Gibbie's adventures not only strangers, but even his intimate friends find themselves naturally falling into this way of regarding the diminutive, elfin 'creature', and are unable to shake off the impression save by a conscious effort.""",['George MacDonald'],,http://books.google.nl/books?id=O4GAvwEACAAJ&dq=Sir+Gibbie&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,,2018-11-15,http://books.google.nl/books?id=O4GAvwEACAAJ&dq=Sir+Gibbie&hl=&source=gbs_api,,
The Call of the Wild and White Fang,"Packaged in handsome, affordable trade editions, Clydesdale Classics is a new series of essential literary works. It features literary phenomena with influence and themes so great that, after their publication, they changed literature forever. From the musings of literary geniuses like Mark Twain in The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn to the striking personal narrative of Harriet Jacobs in Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl, this new series is a comprehensive collection of our history through the words of the exceptional few. Jack London’s The Call of the Wild and White Fang are both adventure stories featuring animal protagonists—a sled dog named Buck and the appropriately named White Fang. Partially told from the perspective of the dogs, these stories gave London the opportunity to explore and predict how animals perceive our world. Buck was Judge Miller’s pet and lived happily in Santa Clara Valley, California. Until one day, when he’s kidnapped by the gardener’s assistant and sold to traders. Eventually he ends up in the Klondike region of Canada, where he is trained to become a sled dog. After he witnesses a fellow sled dog killed by a pack of huskies, Buck starts to shed his domesticated habits and embrace his primordial instincts in order to survive. White Fang, in a similar vein, tells the tale of another canine—a young gray wolf cub who is the strongest of his litter. As he grows, White Fang begins to understand the nature of the wilderness—that it is survival of the fittest: “The aim of life was meat. Life itself was meat. Life lived on life. There were the eaters and the eaten. The law was: EAT OR BE EATEN.” After wandering into an Indian camp, losing his mother, being severely beaten, and being forced into dog-fighting, his life is forever changed as he struggles to find his place in the animal kingdom. In these classic novels, London explores the remarkable relationship between man and beast.",['Jack London'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=dzKCDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=dzKCDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Call+of+the+Wild+and+White+Fang&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Simon and Schuster,2016-05-17,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=dzKCDwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],20.0

In The Big Sea he recounts those memorable years in the two great playgrounds of the decade--Harlem and Paris. In Paris he was a cook and waiter in nightclubs. He knew the musicians and dancers, the drunks and dope fiends. In Harlem he was a rising young poet--at the center of the ""Harlem Renaissance.""

"Gargantua and Pantagruel, (The Modern library of the world's best books)","Popular American essayist, novelist, and journalist CHARLES DUDLEY WARNER (1829-1900) was renowned for the warmth and intimacy of his writing, which encompassed travelogue, biography and autobiography, fiction, and more, and influenced entire generations of his fellow writers. Here, the prolific writer turned editor for his final grand work, a splendid survey of global literature, classic and modern, and it's not too much to suggest that if his friend and colleague Mark Twain-who stole Warner's quip about how ""everybody complains about the weather, but nobody does anything about it""-had assembled this set, it would still be hailed today as one of the great achievements of the book world.

Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,"Referring to ""Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, "" H. L. Mencken noted that his discovery of this classic American novel was ""the most stupendous event of my whole life""; Ernest Hemingway declared that ""all modern American literature stems from this one book,"" while T. S. Eliot called Huck ""one of the permanent symbolic figures of fiction, not unworthy to take a place with Ulysses, Faust, Don Quixote, Don Juan, Hamlet."" The novel's preeminence derives from its wonderfully imaginative re-creation of boyhood adventures along the mighty Mississippi River, its inspired characterization, the author's remarkable ear for dialogue, and the book's understated development of serious underlying themes: ""natural"" man versus ""civilized"" society, the evils of slavery, the innate value and dignity of human beings, the stultifying effects of convention, and other topics. But most of all, ""Adventures of Huckleberry Finn"" is a wonderful story filled with high adventure and unforgettable characters (including the great river itself) that no one who has read it will ever forget.

All Politics Is Personal,"Mark Twain once wrote, ""In religion and politics people's beliefs and convictions are in almost every case gotten at second-hand, and without examination, from authorities who have not themselves examined the questions at issue but have taken them at second-hand from other non-examiners."" This perfectly sums up the current situation in Washington, where our elected officials make law and policy without giving consideration-or even being aware of-the needs of average Americans, creating a disconnect between the ""political"" and the ""personal."" In All Politics Is Personal, Jim Derych contrasts the Beltway rhetoric with the real world to show how politicians on both sides of the political divide routinely fail the voters they're supposed to be representing. Using his unique perspective on the Left and the Right, Jim examines the perceptions of liberals and conservatives on the prevailing issues of the day, comparing these perceptions with the real-life experiences of a cross section of Americans. Read about the passionate debate between a Republican father and his liberal daughter on the Iraq War, then find out what the soldiers who actually fought have to say, or compare the discussion that a conservative talk show host and his liberal guest have on health care with the reality of a cancer patient who lost his insurance coverage. Starting with the conventional, like friends and family members who are loathe to talk politics, and ending with the often heart-wrenching stories of those who have suffered the consequences of today's political disconnect, Jim analyzes the ever-expanding gap between the rhetoric of politicians and the experiences of the people they're supposed to represent. Jim Derych's first book, Confessions of a Former Dittohead, was called ""one of the most important political books of 2006,"" by Markos Moulitsas of Daily Kos.",['Jim Derych'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=5IX8kQEACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=5IX8kQEACAAJ&dq=All+Politics+Is+Personal&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,,2008-09-01,http://books.google.nl/books?id=5IX8kQEACAAJ&dq=All+Politics+Is+Personal&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Political Science'],

In addition to depictions of canal life, the pieces offer glimpses of early tourist resorts, like Trenton Falls, and observations of religious experiments that made New York's ""burned over district"" a hotbed of social and political reform.

Searching for Jane Austen,"Searching for Jane Austen demolishes with wit and vivacity the often-held view of ""Jane,"" a decorous maiden aunt writing her small drawing-room stories of teas and balls. Emily Auerbach presents a different Jane Austen—a brilliant writer who, despite the obstacles facing women of her time, worked seriously on improving her craft and became one of the world’s greatest novelists, a master of wit, irony, and character development. In this beautifully illustrated and lively work, Auerbach surveys two centuries of editing, censoring, and distorting Austen’s life and writings. Auerbach samples Austen’s flamboyant, risqué adolescent works featuring heroines who get drunk, lie, steal, raise armies, and throw rivals out of windows. She demonstrates that Austen constantly tested and improved her skills by setting herself a new challenge in each of her six novels. In addition, Auerbach considers Austen’s final irreverent writings, discusses her tragic death at the age of forty-one, and ferrets out ridiculous modern adaptations and illustrations, including ads, cartoons, book jackets, newspaper articles, plays, and films from our own time. An appendix reprints a ground-breaking article that introduced Mark Twain’s ""Jane Austen,"" an unfinished and unforgettable essay in which Twain and Austen enter into mortal combat.",['Emily Auerbach'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=ainXQ5ljQcEC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=ainXQ5ljQcEC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Searching+for+Jane+Austen&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Univ of Wisconsin Press,2004,http://books.google.com/books?id=ainXQ5ljQcEC&dq=Searching+for+Jane+Austen&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Literary Criticism'],2.0

The Films of Frederic March,"Fredric March (1897-1975) was one of the most dynamic and versatile actors of his time. On the screen he created memorable performances in such classic films as Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, Death Takes a Holiday, Les Miserables, A Star is Born, Nothing Sacred, One Foot in Heaven, The Adventures of Mark Twain, The Best Years of Our Lives, Death of a Salesman and Inherit the Wind. Along the way he was nominated five times for an Academy Award and won the coveted statuette twice. He had an equally distinguished career as a stage actor—appearing in such acclaimed Broadway productions as The Skin of Our Teeth and Long Day’s Journey Into Night—winning two Tony Awards—including the very first presented to an actor. Despite this great record of success, Fredric March isn’t as well remembered today as some of his peers (Gary Cooper, Cary Grant, James Stewart) because unlike them he never developed a recognizable screen persona that followed him from film to film. He was always characterizing—always hiding his own personality behind that of the character he was portraying. He was the consummate actor who richly deserves to be rediscovered. About the Author: Charles Tranberg has written six previous books: I Love the Illusion: The Life and Career of Agnes Moorehead, Not so Dumb: The Life and Career of Marie Wilson, Fred MacMurray: A Biography, The Thin Man Films: Murder over Cocktails, Robert Taylor: A Biography and Walt Disney & Recollections of the Disney Studios 1955-1980.

Gala'pagos,"“A madcap genealogical adventure . . . Vonnegut is a postmodern Mark Twain.”—The New York Times Book Review Galápagos takes the reader back one million years, to A.D. 1986. A simple vacation cruise suddenly becomes an evolutionary journey. Thanks to an apocalypse, a small group of survivors stranded on the Galápagos Islands are about to become the progenitors of a brave, new, and totally different human race. In this inimitable novel, America’ s master satirist looks at our world and shows us all that is sadly, madly awry–and all that is worth saving.

Everyday Graces: Child's Book Of Good Manners,"The regrettable fact is that the subject of manners is not much discussed anymore, and good manners seem practiced even less. But good manners are a prerequisite for the growth of moral character; they are the habits of conduct and behavior by which we express in the most ordinary circumstances our fundamental respect for others, whether parents, friends, colleagues, or strangers. Fortunately, Karen Santorum has produced for parents and teachers a wonderfully rich and instructive anthology to help instill good manners in our children—and stand against a decline of civility and a coarsening of our common life. Under such headings as “Honor Your Mother and Father,” “Please and Thank You,” “No Hurtful Words,” “Good Behavior in Sport,” and “Showing Respect for Country,” Everyday Graces features stories and poems that will develop and enrich the moral imagination. This marvelous anthology features classic selections from such well-known authors as Hans Christian Anderson, Beatrix Potter, Mark Twain, Frances Hodgson Burnett, C. S. Lewis, Max Lucado, and Arnold Lobel, as well as forgotten gems that deserve a new hearing. Mrs. Santorum writes that this anthology grew out of the frustration of not being able to find a book on manners that instructs through stories rather than by rules of dos and don'ts. She and her husband tried and tested many of these selections on their six children. Each of the selections is briefly introduced with a thoughtful commentary at the close, producing an informality and intimacy that is inviting and infectious. Find out why Everyday Graces has become a beloved feature in homes, schools, churches, and libraries across America.","['Karen Santorum', 'Michael E.

A Private History of Awe,"An original and searching memoir from ""one of America's finest essayists"" (Phillip Lopate) When Scott Russell Sanders was four, his father held him in his arms during a thunderstorm, and he felt awe—""the tingle of a power that surges through bone and rain and everything."" He says, ""The search for communion with this power has run like a bright thread through all my days."" A Private History of Awe is an account of this search, told as a series of awe-inspiring episodes: his early memory of watching a fire with his father; his attraction to the solemn cadences of the Bible despite his frustration with Sunday-school religion; his discovery of books and the body; his mounting opposition to the Vietnam War and all forms of violence; his decision to leave behind the university life of Oxford and Harvard and return to Indiana, where three generations of his family have put down roots. In many ways, this is the story of a generation's passage through the 1960s—from innocence to experience, from euphoria to disillusionment. But Sanders has found a language that captures the transcendence of ordinary lives while never reducing them to formula. In his hands, the pattern of American boyhood that was made classic by writers from Mark Twain to Tobias Wolff is given a powerful new charge.",['Scott Russell Sanders'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=DbC0euTdbnUC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=DbC0euTdbnUC&printsec=frontcover&dq=A+Private+History+of+Awe&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,North Point Press,2007-05-15,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=DbC0euTdbnUC&source=gbs_api,['Biography & Autobiography'],2.0

Mark Twain,"Mark Twain, the American comic genius who portrayed, named, and in part exemplified America’s “Gilded Age,” comes alive in Justin Kaplan’s extraordinary biography. With brilliant immediacy, Mr. Clemens and Mark Twain brings to life a towering literary figure whose dual persona symbolized the emerging American conflict between down-to-earth morality and freewheeling ambition. As Mark Twain, he was the Mississippi riverboat pilot, the satirist with a fiery hatred of pretension, and the author of such classics as Tom Sawyer andHuckleberry Finn. As Mr. Clemens, he was the star who married an heiress, built a palatial estate, threw away fortunes on harebrained financial schemes, and lived the extravagant life that Mark Twain despised. Kaplan effectively portrays the triumphant-tragic man whose achievements and failures, laughter and anger, reflect a crucial generation in our past as well as his own dark, divided, and remarkably contemporary spirit. Mr. Clemens and Mark Twain brilliantly conveys this towering literary figure who was himself a symbol of the peculiarly American conflict between moral scrutiny and the drive to succeed. Mr. Clemens lived the Gilded Life that Mark Twain despised. The merging and fragmenting of these and other identities, as the biography unfolds, results in a magnificent projection of the whole man; the great comic spirit; and the exuberant, tragic human being, who, his friend William Dean Howells said, was “sole, incomparable, the Lincoln of our literature.”",['Justin Kaplan'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=lj1Rc68iZ0YC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=lj1Rc68iZ0YC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Mark+Twain&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Simon and Schuster,2008-06-30,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=lj1Rc68iZ0YC&source=gbs_api,['Biography & Autobiography'],3.0

Convergence Marketing: Strategies for Reaching the New Hybrid Consumer,"Preface: Running with the Centaur ""A businessman is a hybrid of a dancer and a calculator."" —Paul Valery, French Poet and Philosopher The Internet revolution didn't turn out to be anything like we thought it would be. At the end of the 1990s, the discussion of many observers, we among them, focused on the rise of the ""cyberconsumer"" and the emergence of ""Internet marketing."" At the extreme, the image of this cyberconsumer was humorously caricatured in a series of Sprint commercials introducing its wireless web, in which people hunched over their computers in dark rooms were invited at long last to step out into the sunlit world. The business model designed for the cyberconsumer was the ""pure play"" Internet firm, either a separate dot-com or a stand-alone division of a larger company. But the cyberconsumer was largely a myth. Consumers didn't behave anything like we thought they would. Today, we are entering the age of the centaur. Consumers act across multiple channels. They combine timeless human needs and behaviors with new online activities. They are like the centaur of Greek mythology--half human and half horse—running with the rapid feet of new technology, yet carrying the same ancient and unpredictable human heart. This consumer is a combination of traditional and cyber, rational and emotional, wired and physical. This consumer is not either/or, but both. The authors came to this center from opposite directions. Jerry Wind was an early champion of digital marketing, highlighting the revolutionary changes of the Internet on consumer behavior, marketing and business strategy. He urged executives to consider the potential of this new technology to transform their businesses. Vijay Mahajan pointed out that not everything had changed, and that many aspects of consumer behavior and marketing remained the same. He urged executives to consider the enduring human characteristics that would continue to shape marketing and business strategy. As we discussed the issue from these two viewpoints, working on a series of projects that led to this book, we came to the conclusion that we were both right: the reality was the hybrid consumer. This is not to suggest that there are three separate segments (traditional, cyberconsumer and centaur). The reality is convergence. The entire market is becoming centaurs, either directly or indirectly (even if someone is not online, their behavior will still be affected by new technologies, channels and products, and service offerings). This is why we focus so much on the centaur. The centaurs, in turn, are heterogeneous, so there will be many segments among these hybrid consumers. Even the most tech savvy of U.S. consumers—the 18 to 25 year olds of Generation Y—are not strictly cyberconsumers. A recent survey of more than 600 Gen-Y respondents (51 percent of whom had made online purchases in the past year) found that nearly 40 percent learned about the product online, but bought at a physical store, whereas only 9.3 percent began and ended their search online. When asked where they would prefer to shop, nearly three-quarters chose a store rather than online. Across the spectrum, consumers are combining various channels and approaches, searching online to buy offline, searching offline to buy online—and everything in between. Charles Schwab found that while about 90 percent of all trades are handled online, 60-70 percent of new accounts are set up in branch offices. People want to be able to see whom they are working with when they turn over their money. Benefits of Convergence The power of hybrid models can be seen in the success of Tesco, which raced past pioneers such as Peapod and Webvan to become the largest online grocer in the world. Tesco, using its century-old platform of retail stores in the U.K. as the launching pad for its online service, created a profitable online business that was handling 70,000 orders per week by mid 2001 and had racked up more than $400 million in sales the year before. Tesco could set up its online grocery business for a fraction of the investment of Webvan because it was able to build off its existing infrastructure. Tesco has moved into the U.S. market, purchasing a 35 percent investment in Safeway's online grocery service in June 2001, and announcing plans for expansion into South Korea. The power and profit of the hybrid model can also be seen in the success of Staples.com, which expected to grow online revenues to $1 billion in 2001, nearly 10 percent of company sales. Even more significant, Staples found that the addition of the new channel is not cannibalistic, but synergistic. Overall, customers who shop in the store and catalog spend twice as much as those who shop in the store alone, and customers that shop using the store, catalog, and online channels spend an average of $2,500, nearly four times as much as store shoppers. The results achieved by Staples and other firms offer a sense of the potential return on investment from meeting the centaur. Convergence strategies offer a variety of opportunities for generating new revenues, reducing costs and creating valuable options for the future. Changing Mind Sets There is emerging evidence of the immediate benefits of convergence strategies, if investments are made strategically, but these short-term gains are not the only opportunity. Our focus is to look at the opportunities, both short- and long-term, created by the emergence of the hybrid consumer and how companies can capitalize on these opportunities. The last category may be the most important: the options that convergence strategies create for the future. This book takes a broader view of the strategic impact of the centaur for marketing and business strategy, and the architecture of the organization. If you believe, as we do, that the centaur is the future of our markets, then the ability to succeed in the future depends on understanding and ""running with"" the centaur. Failure to understand these changes creates the risk of significant lost opportunities. What can the integration of the offline marketplace and the online marketspace do for consumers that neither can do alone? What business principles will guide the integration? How is marketing changing? How do these shifts affect short-term and long-term profitability and growth? What Is Converging Convergence, as we discuss it here, means more than the fusion of different technologies (television, computers, wireless, PDAs) or the combination of channels (such as Tesco's or Staple's bricks-and-clicks model). We focus on a more basic convergence within the consumer—the new possibilities created by the technology and the enduring behaviors of human beings. This convergence will shape how the Internet and other new technologies unfold, and the opportunities created for companies. What can consumers do with the technology that they could not do in the past? When will they continue to do things in the way they always have? Although most of the focus in this book is on business-to-consumer interactions, many of the insights apply equally to business-to-business strategy. The line between B2B and B2C is already blurring. In an environment in which Sun Microsystems is selling products on eBay, is this B2B or B2C? In an environment in which a customer may soon be able to click an order button for an automobile and set in motion a global supply chain to deliver that car, where does B2C end and B2B begin? Lessons from the Dot-Coms This book examines the practices of a variety of companies, but we must stress at the outset that these firms are not held up as ultimate models. They all have something to teach us, but many of the successful companies of a year or two ago are now fighting for their lives. And some companies that were all but written off are back in force. We suspect the same unpredictable dynamic will be seen in the future. This is a particularly dangerous time to engage in benchmarking or to search for excellence. It is not a time for simple recipes. Instead, it is far more important to gain a deeper understanding of how consumers are changing and how they are remaining the same. The actions of these hybrid consumers will shape the way technology is adopted and, ultimately, the future of your markets. We should take a balanced view of dot-com failures. Mark Twain once said, ""We should be careful to get out of an experience only the wisdom that is in it."" Twain gives the example of a cat who sits on a hot stove, and learns not to sit on a hot stove again—but also won't sit on a cold stove. The failures of the first wave of dot-coms offer many lessons about what to do, and what not to do, but we need to be careful in taking lessons from them. Although some of the companies that failed had weak business models, some actually had brilliant marketing strategies and business models. The failure of the business is not necessarily an indictment of the idea. Some may have arrived slightly ahead of their time. Some may have suffered from poor execution. It may be that the time is now right for these ideas to flourish. During the Internet bubble, we have engaged in one of the most extensive, investor-financed experiments in new business models and paradigms. There has been an explosion of experimentation. Although many of these experiments proved to be unprofitable, many new ideas were developed and tested. Incumbent companies and startups that are still alive can benefit greatly from the acceleration of knowledge from this dot-com ""school of hard knocks."" Pick through the wreckage and look carefully at what happened. Then take away the lessons that you can use. The Implications of the Centaur In this book, we offer insights to top executives and key organizational change agents on the characteristics and behavior of these hybrid centaurs and how we need to reshape our marketing and business strategy to meet them. The book explores different intersections between the consumer, technology and company and their implications for marketing and business strategy and organizational design. We examine the emergence of the centaur, and the marketing, business and organizational challenges and opportunities created. Part I offers a portrait of this centaur, what has changed and what remains the same. We also discuss how the focus on the customer has often been lost in the emphasis on technology. These centaurs are complex beings, with a love-hate relationship with the technology, buying books from Amazon.com one day and relaxing in an armchair sipping cappuccino at Barnes & Noble the next. Part II explores issues at the intersection between the consumer and technology. We consider five key issues at the core of addressing these new hybrid consumers—customerization, communities, channel options, new competitive value propositions, and choice tools. Although these issues have been discussed in the context of the cyberconsumer, they are quite different from the perspective of the centaur. Sometimes consumers want customerization (customized products and services as well as customized marketing), but other times they want to pull standard products off the shelf and receive mass marketing messages. Consumers are members of both physical and virtual communities. The hybrid consumers want to be able—in the words of Fidelity—to ""call, click, or visit."" They are redefining the traditional sources of value, buying products by auction or fixed price or name-your-own price depending on their mood and purchase situation, creating a new value equation. Finally, the Internet offers powerful tools to find information, make decisions, and manage one's life. These tools empower consumers, changing the way they interact with the company. How can you create convergence strategies to address these interrelated issues? Part III examines the impact of the centaur on marketing and business strategies. As the consumer connects much more directly to companies, marketing has a deeper role to play. Marketing creates new opportunities for growth and rethinking the company's offering, pricing and market boundaries. The centaur has also transformed the traditional 4 Ps of marketing, along with strategies for segmentation, positioning, customer relationships, branding, and marketing research. As these changes send shockwaves through the organization, another type of convergence is called for—in organizational design. Part IV explores some of the fundamental transformations established organizations need to undergo to meet the centaur. To navigate the whitewater rapids of convergence and change, organizations need new organizational architectures. They need to change their architectures, creating a broader ""c-change"" to facilitate convergence across the organization and its ecosystem. The overall objective is to suggest a new consumer-centric mental model through which to examine the entire business. The kind of shift we are talking about is what Bill Gates describes in the transformation of Microsoft's original mission of ""a PC on every desk"" to its current mission to ""empower people through great software, any time, any place and on any device."" The focus is on the convergence of technology and consumer needs. This book is designed to be an interactive experience. Each chapter begins with a dialogue representing different viewpoints on convergence. Callouts highlight key convergence questions that you can use to challenge yourself and to assess your company's progress. Finally, the close of every chapter offers an ""action memo,"" a set of illustrative hands-on experiments for exploring and applying convergence strategies. We have found the only way to master these new technologies and strategies is to actually experience them and apply them to your own business. These ""action memos"" are not intended to be exhaustive or to summarize key themes of the chapter, but represent a starting point for your own experiments. We encourage you to share those experiments with us, and other readers, at the Convergence Marketing Forum (convergencemarketingforum.com). The Relentless March of the Centaur As Internet penetration increases—and new technologies emerge—we are seeing a relentless march of these new hybrid centaurs. We cannot judge the potential of the Internet and other technologies by their current primitive level of development. John Hagel, author of Net Gain and Net Worth, says if we compare the Internet to a ballgame, we are still waiting for the national anthem to finish. Michael Nelson, Director of Internet Technology and Strategy at IBM, estimated in 2000 that we were maybe 3 percent of the way into the Internet revolution. He also points out that increased speed of connection, which has been a central focus of attention in the evolution of the Internet, is only a small part of the power of the emerging online world. In addition to raw speed, the fact that the Internet will be always on, everywhere, natural, intelligent, easy, and trusted, will deepen the role of the Internet in our lives. Nelson compares the development of the Internet to the early days of the electric grid. ""The Internet right now is at the light bulb stage,"" Nelson said. ""The light bulb is very useful, but it is only one of thousands of uses of electricity. Similarly, when the next-generation Internet is fully deployed, we will use it in thousands of different ways, many of which we can't even imagine now. It will just be part of everyday life—like electricity or plumbing is today. We'll know we've achieved this when we stop talking about 'going on the Internet.' When you blow dry your hair, you don't talk about 'going on' the electric grid."" There will be naysayers who will use the limitations of the current state of technology as a reason for inaction. Customization is often neither cheap nor simple. Early interfaces with online sites were clunky at best and many home connections remain slow. Throughout this book, we look at the current and future potential of technology and explore how the consumer will interact with it. We won't waste your time giving you a repair manual for a Model T, but instead explore how motor vehicles (particularly newer, more reliable versions) create opportunities for activities such as commerce and family vacations by car. While we must be realistic, we cannot become too mired in the past when the future is so rapidly emerging. Children of Centaurs: In the Forests of the North It is clear that we are just getting started with the Internet, and we are even earlier on the learning curve for the new wireless consumers beginning to emerge. Even as businesses are scurrying to absorb the revolution of the Internet, teenagers in Europe and Asia are already shaping the next revolution in mobile communication and commerce. This revolution will play out differently in different parts of the world, and it will probably play out differently than we expect, unless we truly understand the new hybrid consumer. It poses new convergence challenges, but raises the same timeless questions: How will consumers interact with the technology? Again, this interaction between people and technology will not always be as businesses anticipated. Helsinki teenager Lauri Taehtinen, speaking on a panel of Finnish teenagers at the Wharton Fellows in e-Business Program, said that when he goes out on a Friday night, he doesn't make plans anymore. Instead the 19-year-old goes downtown and starts sending short messages on his mobile phone, pinging his friends to see who's out there. They connect by cell phone and then decide where they want to go for the evening. While companies are excited about developing mobile information services that might help customers identify night clubs or order fast food, Taehtinen and his peers are more interested in connection. In an environment in which virtually every teenager carries a mobile phone (Finnish market penetration of 78 percent means almost every citizen above the age of 10 carries at least one mobile phone), the mobile conversation is continuous and ubiquitous. Among U.K. teens, short messages outnumber phone conversations three to one, and the parallel phenomenon of instant messaging is one of the most popular applications of teenagers on the PC in the United States and other parts of the world. The very fact that short messages (SMS) are the top application of mobile phones in Finland is, at first, a surprising thing. The handsets, designed for voice, are not friendly to the process of messaging. Users tap out their 160-word messages on numeric keyboards through complex, rapid-fire keystrokes, smart systems, and creative workarounds. With users paying a charge to send each message on most systems, it would seem unlikely that SMS would be a central part of the mobile phone business. But these young centaurs want to communicate, and they don't let the technology get in their way. It was only in the interaction between consumers and technology that that power of short messages became apparent. Just as email has been the killer application of the Internet, mobile technology is being bent to the human desire to communicate and connect. ""People don't want to be entertained,"" Taehtinen bluntly states. ""They don't want information. If you go into Internet cafes, you see people are not reading the news; they are all sending email or chatting online. They are willing to pay for social interaction. People want to belong to something."" Enduring Lessons While communications and information technology may be ephemeral and uncertain, there are at least two enduring lessons: The first is that the new technologies, as much as their proponents may want them to, do not replace the old. They live side by side, and they converge. The second is that people are complex, retaining the same enduring human needs even as they adapt to new technologies and behaviors. These may seem like fairly obvious, even simplistic, statements. But they have been overlooked more often than recognized in the mad rush to adopt new technology. These realities have fundamental implications for marketing and business strategy. What they mean is that there needs to be a convergence of the old technology and the new to create a portfolio of technologies and channels. The storefront and catalog don't go away when you add the Internet. And, even more important, there is an interaction between humans and technology that changes both. There is a convergence of old consumer behaviors and new behaviors that affects the trajectory of technology, the strategies for marketing and, ultimately, the design of the business. More Human The wonderful thing about our interactions with machines is not in the ways machines can be made to behave in more human ways, but in the way these interactions make it easier for us to see what distinguishes us as humans. The more we move to machine-mediated interactions, the more we see the fundamental and enduring behaviors that are at the core of marketing and business strategy. It is this interaction between man and machine that is changing us, transforming the practice of marketing and our organizations. In this book, we examine how we need to transform our thinking about the nature of these emerging consumers. We explore how to reach these centaurs and establish long-lasting relationships with them. We look at the ways that they remain the same and the ways that they are fundamentally different in their expectations and behaviors. And we consider how they have irrevocably changed—and continue to change—the theory and practice of marketing, and the design of our organizations.","['Yoram Wind', 'Vijay Mahajan']",http://books.google.com/books/content?id=QoSNQgAACAAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=QoSNQgAACAAJ&dq=Convergence+Marketing:+Strategies+for+Reaching+the+New+Hybrid+Consumer&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Ft Press,2002-01,http://books.google.com/books?id=QoSNQgAACAAJ&dq=Convergence+Marketing:+Strategies+for+Reaching+the+New+Hybrid+Consumer&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Business & Economics'],

"St. Nicholas and Mary Mapes Dodge: The Legacy of a Children's Magazine Editor, 1873-1905","St. Nicholas has been called the best children's magazine ever published, particularly during the tenure of its founding editor, Mary Mapes Dodge. From 1873 to 1905, Dodge worked to create what she called a ""pleasure ground"" for children--a magazine that would have great impact on several generations of children. The list of authors who wrote for her includes Louisa May Alcott, Frances Hodgson Burnett, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Rudyard Kipling, Theodore Roosevelt, and Mark Twain. The quality of the magazine's illustration was equally high. The magazine was also the launching pad for a new generation of authors and artists, such as F. Scott Fitzgerald, E.B. White, Jack London, and Eudora Welty. This anthology of critical writing on St. Nicholas includes some of the most influential articles already published and newly commissioned essays on a variety of subjects, including the impact of the St. Nicholas league, the utopian thrust of the magazine's fiction, and the story of the long and productive literary partnership between Dodgeand Alcott. Essays also analyze Dodge's relationship with her readers, her editorial practice, the illustrations, American family life as seen by young British readers, war and military life, advertising, and the middle-class preoccupation with ""change of fortune"" tales. The work places St. Nicholas in American cultural history, and analyzes how it both influenced and was influenced over thirty years. Essential documentary material presently unpublished or inaccessible and illustrations from the magazine are also included.","['Susan R.

Mark Twain: A Literary Life,"Selected by Choice magazine as an Outstanding Academic Title for 2000 ""Mark Twain endures. Readers sense his humanity, enjoy his humor, and appreciate his insights into human nature, even into such painful experiences as embarrassment and humiliation. No matter how remarkable the life of Samuel Clemens was, what matters most is the relationship of Mark Twain the writer and his writings. That is the subject of this book.""—from the Preface In Mark Twain, A Literary Life, Everett Emerson revisits one of America's greatest and most popular writers to explore the relationship between the life of the writer and his writings. The assumption throughout is that to see Mark Twain's writings in focus, one must give proper attention to their biographical context. Mark Twain's literary career is fascinating in its strangeness. How could this genius have had so little sense of what he should next do? As a young man, Samuel Clemens's first vocation, that of journeyman printer, took him far from home to the sights of New York, Philadelphia, and Washington, while his next vocation would give him the identity by which we most frequently know him. His choice of ""Mark Twain"" as a pen name cemented his bond with the river, as did such books as Life on the Mississippi and Huckleberry Finn. Then following an unsuccessful try at silver mining, Clemens worked as a newspaperman, humorist, lecturer, but also cultivated an interest in playwriting, politics, and philosophizing. In reporting the author's life, Emerson has endeavored to permit Mark Twain to tell his own story as much as possible, through the use of letters and autobiographical writings, some unpublished. These fascinating glimpses into the life of the writer will be of interest to all who have an abiding affection for Samuel Clemens and his extraordinary legacy.",['Everett Emerson'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=FxQmDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=FxQmDgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Mark+Twain:+A+Literary+Life&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,University of Pennsylvania Press,2017-02-17,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=FxQmDgAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Biography & Autobiography'],

Shadow and Act,"With the same intellectual incisiveness and supple, stylish prose he brought to his classic novel Invisible Man, Ralph Ellison examines his antecedents and in so doing illuminates the literature, music, and culture of both black and white America. His range is virtuosic, encompassing Mark Twain and Richard Wright, Mahalia Jackson and Charlie Parker, The Birth of a Nation and the Dante-esque landscape of Harlem−""the scene and symbol of the Negro's perpetual alienation in the land of his birth."" Throughout, he gives us what amounts to an episodic autobiography that traces his formation as a writer as well as the genesis of Invisible Man. On every page, Ellison reveals his idiosyncratic and often contrarian brilliance, his insistence on refuting both black and white stereotypes of what an African American writer should say or be. The result is a book that continues to instruct, delight, and occasionally outrage readers thirty years after it was first published.",['Ralph Ellison'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=QiXMxUifFs8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=QiXMxUifFs8C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Shadow+and+Act&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Vintage,2011-06-01,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=QiXMxUifFs8C&source=gbs_api,['Literary Collections'],

Being Frank: My Time with Frank Zappa,"Since his untimely death from prostate cancer in 1993, the legend of iconoclastic musician Frank Zappa has continued to grow. The years following his passing have seen the publication of numerous books, both sacred and profane, which examine his life and work, but the best, and only, up-close-and-personal account of the man and his music remains the original: Nigey Lennon’s Being Frank: My Time with Frank Zappa. Musician/author Lennon maintained a personal and professional relationship with Zappa during the period which is generally agreed to have been the composer’s most creative, and she invests her recollections with considerable musical and emotional insight. The fact that Lennon is an accomplished musician and composer in her own right enables her to perceptively analyze Zappa's complex music, and her previous experience as a biographer of Mark Twain and Alfred Jarry is evident as she examines the complex conditions of Zappa's turbulent life. But above all, Being Frank is simply a great read: filled with wry humor, poignancy, and, of course, a plethora of the juicy road stories that Zappa himself didn't dare to include in his own autobiography. The e-book edition of Being Frank is certain to find a new audience for this classic title, which has been in great demand since its third print run sold out several years ago. “Irreplaceable...is the word to describe Being Frank...[Lennon's] memoir is both spiky and musically literate...Lennon’s previous books were on Mark Twain and Alfred Jarry, which indicates the kind of cultural perspective required to get a grip on Zappa: something brighter than rock-journo pedantry.” –Ben Watson, author of Frank Zappa: The Negative Dialectics of Poodle Play",['Nigey Lennon'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=PFwDKuYFL14C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=PFwDKuYFL14C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Being+Frank:+My+Time+with+Frank+Zappa&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,SCB Distributors,2011-03-23,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=PFwDKuYFL14C&source=gbs_api,['Music'],

"Mark Twain: The Gilded Age and Later Novels: The Gilded Age / The American Claimant / Tom Sawyer Abroad / Tom Sawyer, Detective / No. 44, The Mysterious Stranger (Library of America)","""Against the assault of laughter nothing can stand,"" Mark Twain once wrote. In this sixth volume in The Library of America's authoritative collection of his writings-the final volume of his fiction-America's greatest humorist emerges in a surprising range of roles: as the savvy satirist of The Gilded Age, the brilliant plotter of its inventive sequel, The American Claimant, and, in two Tom Sawyer novels, as the acknowledged master revisiting his best-loved characters. Also in this volume is the authoritative version of Twain's haunting last novel, No. 44, The Mysterious Stranger, left unpublished when he died. The Gilded Age (1873), a collaboration with Hartford neighbor Charles Dudley Warner, sends up an age when vast fortunes piled up amid thriving corruption and a city Twain knew well, Washington, D.C., full of would-be power brokers and humbug. The novel also gives us one of Twain's most enduring characters, Colonel Sellers, who returns in The American Claimant (1892), an encore performance that moves beyond the worldly satire of its predecessor into realms of sheer inventive mayhem. Tom Sawyer Abroad (1894) and Tom Sawyer, Detective (1896) extend the adventures of Huck and Tom. No. 44, The Mysterious Stranger (1908), an astonishing psychic adventure set in the gothic gloom of a medieval Austrian village, offers a powerful and uncanny exploration of the powers of the human mind.

"Rough-hewn,","""Rough-Hewn Land tells the geologic story of the American West--the story of its rocks, rivers, mountains, earthquakes, and mineral wealth, including gold. It tells it by taking you on a 1000-mile-long field trip across the rough side of the continent from the California coast to the Rocky Mountains. This book puts you on the outcrop, geologic hammer in hand, to explore the evidence for how the spectacular, rough-hewn lands of the West came to be. When North America broke free from Eurasia and Africa some 200 million years ago, it triggered a cascade of violent geologic events that shaped the West we see today. As the west-moving continent crunched across the seabed of the ancient Pacific, islands and assorted pieces of ocean floor collected against its prow to build California--and plant gold there too. Meanwhile, mountains squeezed upward from California to Colorado, and vast quantities of molten rock seeded the crust with precious metals while spewing volcanic fire across the land. Later, the land stretched like an accordion to form the washboard-like Basin and Range province and Great Basin within it, while California began to crackle along the San Andreas fault. Throughout the West today, a near-constant drumroll of earthquakes testifies to a world still reshaping itself in response to the ceaseless movements of the Earth's tectonic plates. Rough-Hewn Land weaves these stories into the human history of the West. As we follow the adventures of John C. Frémont, Mark Twain, the Donner party, and other historic characters, we see how geologic forces have shaped human experience, just as they direct the fate of the West today""--",['Keith Heyer Meldahl'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=pakwDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.com/books?id=pakwDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=Rough-hewn,&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",Univ of California Press,2013-05,"http://books.google.com/books?id=pakwDwAAQBAJ&dq=Rough-hewn,&hl=&source=gbs_api",['History'],1.0
The Passenger Pigeon,"At the start of the nineteenth century, Passenger Pigeons were perhaps the most abundant birds on the planet, numbering literally in the billions. The flocks were so large and so dense that they blackened the skies, even blotting out the sun for days at a stretch. Yet by the end of the century, the most common bird in North America had vanished from the wild. In 1914, the last known representative of her species, Martha, died in a cage at the Cincinnati Zoo. This stunningly illustrated book tells the astonishing story of North America's Passenger Pigeon, a bird species that—like the Tyrannosaur, the Mammoth, and the Dodo—has become one of the great icons of extinction. Errol Fuller describes how these fast, agile, and handsomely plumaged birds were immortalized by the ornithologist and painter John James Audubon, and captured the imagination of writers such as James Fenimore Cooper, Henry David Thoreau, and Mark Twain. He shows how widespread deforestation, the demand for cheap and plentiful pigeon meat, and the indiscriminate killing of Passenger Pigeons for sport led to their catastrophic decline. Fuller provides an evocative memorial to a bird species that was once so important to the ecology of North America, and reminds us of just how fragile the natural world can be. Published in the centennial year of Martha’s death, The Passenger Pigeon features rare archival images as well as haunting photos of live birds.",['Errol Fuller'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=MGuYDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=MGuYDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Passenger+Pigeon&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Princeton University Press,2014-09-15,http://books.google.com/books?id=MGuYDwAAQBAJ&dq=The+Passenger+Pigeon&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Nature'],

In God We Trust : But Which One?,"The beloved, bestselling classic that became the movie, A CHRISTMAS STORY -- humorous and nostalgic Americana, reissued in a strikingly designed paperback edition. Before Garrison Keillor and Spalding Gray there was Jean Shepherd: a master monologist and writer who spun the materials of his all-American childhood into immensely resonant--and utterly hilarious--works of comic art. In God We Trust: All Others Pay Cash represents one of the peaks of his achievement, a compound of irony, affection, and perfect detail that speaks across generations. In God We Trust, Shepherd's wildly witty reunion with his Indiana hometown, disproves the adage ""You can never go back."" Bending the ear of Flick, his childhood-buddy-turned-bartender, Shepherd recalls passionately his genuine Red Ryder BB gun, confesses adolescent failure in the arms of Junie Jo Prewitt, and relives a story of man against fish that not even Hemingway could rival. From pop art to the World's Fair, Shepherd's subjects speak with a universal irony and are deeply and unabashedly grounded in American Midwestern life, together rendering a wonderfully nostalgic impression of a more innocent era when life was good, fun was clean, and station wagons roamed the earth. A comic genius who bridged the gap between James Thurber and David Sedaris, Shepherd may have accomplished for Holden, Indiana, what Mark Twain did for Hannibal, Missouri.",['Jean Shepherd'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=cHpM9jx9roIC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=cHpM9jx9roIC&printsec=frontcover&dq=In+God+We+Trust+:+But+Which+One%3F&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Crown,2010-10-27,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=cHpM9jx9roIC&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],17.0

Terry Pratchett's profoundly irreverent Discworld novels satirize and celebrate every aspect of life, modern and ancient, sacred and profane. Consistent number-one bestsellers in England, they have garnered him a secure position in the pantheon of humor along with Mark Twain, Douglas Adams, Matt Groening, and Jonathan Swift. Even so distinguished an author as A. S. Byatt has sung his praises, calling Pratchett's intricate and delightful fictional Discworld ""more complicated and satisfying than Oz."" His latest satiric triumph, Carpe Jugulum, involves an exclusive royal snafu that leads to comic mayhem. In a fit of enlightenment democracy and ebullient goodwill, King Verence invites Uberwald's undead, the Magpyrs, into Lancre to celebrate the birth of his daughter. But once ensconced within the castle, these wine-drinking, garlic-eating, sun-loving modern vampires have no intention of leaving. Ever. Only an uneasy alliance between a nervous young priest and the argumentative local witches can save the country from being taken over by people with a cultivated bloodlust and bad taste in silk waistcoats. For them, there's only one way to fight. Go for the throat, or as the vampyres themselves say...Carpe Jugulum",['Terry Pratchett'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=cdewDGNdEkcC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=cdewDGNdEkcC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Carpe+Jugulum&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Harper Collins,2009-10-13,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=cdewDGNdEkcC&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],57.0
Moe Howard Died For Our Sins: made-to-fit tales for the maladjusted,"READ THE BOOK. SHARE THE FAITH. PASS THE SELTZER. Nominated for the 2005 James Thurber Prize for American Humor ""...Dale Andrew White is a natural born storyteller with an especial flair for blending fantasy, whimsy, satire, and a fevered imagination into original stories that are replete with ribald humor and reader-engaging novelty. Subtitled made-to-fit tales for the maladjusted, this collection of short stories showcase a genuine and offbeat talent... Highly recommended reading!"" - Midwest Book Review ""Dale Andrew White is a devious writer and his new collection, Moe Howard Died For Our Sins, provides incriminating evidence of this. On the one hand, the flavor his tales faintly evokes the decayed ante-bellum style of Southern literature that is both lyrically humorous and self-deprecating: the sort of thing we get in Faulkners Sartoris or Mark Twains Huckleberry Finn. ... On the other hand, this is not the satire of Ambrose Bierce or H.L. Mencken. It is more like the kind of in-your-face semantic slapstick that you might expect of a George Carlin or Lenny Bruce... To open this collection is to invite trouble - and probably enjoy it. ...

Ordways,"“Good writing is rare enough. Storytelling is an even rarer skill. A genuinely comic vision is beyond price. The Ordways has all three.” —Time On the annual graveyard-working day in Clarksville, Texas, families come from all over East Texas to pay respects to their loved ones. The Ordways are one such clan, and in this eloquent and original novel, our narrator recounts the story of how he and his kin arrived in this magical land where the South meets the West. The tale begins with his great-grandfather, Thomas Ordway, who lost his sight at the Battle of Shiloh and vowed to quit Tennessee forever. He crossed the Red River into Texas and stopped on the edge of the featureless prairie, a landscape too mystifying even for a sightless man. Years later, the narrator’s grandfather, Sam Ordway, was forced to leave the forest behind when his three-year-old son, Ned, was kidnapped by a neighbor. Sam scoured the vast state of Texas in search of Ned but never found the boy. The mystery of what happened to him and what his long-hoped-for return might mean to the Ordways brings William Humphrey’s brilliant second novel to its rich and satisfying conclusion. A masterful blend of comedy, tragedy, and history, The Ordways is great American fiction in the tradition of William Faulkner and Mark Twain.

Love Letters of Great Men and Women,"Remember the wonderfully romantic book of love letters that Carrie reads aloud to Big in the recent blockbuster film, Sex and the City? Fans raced to buy copies of their own, only to find out that the beautiful book didn't actually exist. However, since all of the letters referenced in the film did exist, we decided to publish this gorgeous keepsake ourselves. Love Letters of Great Men follows hot on the heels of the film and collects together some of history's most romantic letters from the private papers of Beethoven, Mark Twain, Mozart, and Lord Byron. For some of these great men, love is ""a delicious poison"" (William Congreve); for others, ""a nice soft wife on a sofa with good fire, & books & music"" (Charles Darwin). Love can scorch like the heat of the sun (Henry VIII), or penetrate the depths of one's heart like a cooling rain (Flaubert). Every shade of love is here, from the exquisite eloquence of Oscar Wilde and the simple devotion of Robert Browning, to the wonderfully modern misery of the Roman Pliny the Younger, losing himself in work to forget how much he misses his beloved wife, Calpurnia. Taken together, these letters show that perhaps men haven't changed all that much over the last 2,000 years--passion, jealousy, hope and longing still rule their hearts and minds. In an age of e-mail and texted ""i luv u""s, this timeless and unique collection reminds us that nothing can compare to the simple joy of sitting down to read a letter from the one you love.",['Ursula Doyle'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=1_ll1lXPY0MC&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=1_ll1lXPY0MC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Love+Letters+of+Great+Men+and+Women&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,St. Martin's Press,2008-11-25,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=1_ll1lXPY0MC&source=gbs_api,['Literary Collections'],3.0

Another Roadside Attraction Signed,"“Written with a style and humor that haven’t been seen since Mark Twain.”—Los Angeles Times What if the Second Coming didn’t quite come off as advertised? What if “the Corpse” on display in that funky roadside zoo is really who they say it is—what does that portend for the future of western civilization? And what if a young clairvoyant named Amanda reestablishes the flea circus as popular entertainment and fertility worship as the principal religious form of our high-tech age? Another Roadside Attraction answers those questions and a lot more. It tell us, for example, what the sixties were truly all about, not by reporting on the psychedelic decade but by recreating it, from the inside out. In the process, this stunningly original seriocomic thriller is fully capable of simultaneously eating a literary hot dog and eroding the borders of the mind. “Hard to put down because of the sheer brilliance and fun of the writing.

Shadow and act,"With the same intellectual incisiveness and supple, stylish prose he brought to his classic novel Invisible Man, Ralph Ellison examines his antecedents and in so doing illuminates the literature, music, and culture of both black and white America. His range is virtuosic, encompassing Mark Twain and Richard Wright, Mahalia Jackson and Charlie Parker, The Birth of a Nation and the Dante-esque landscape of Harlem−""the scene and symbol of the Negro's perpetual alienation in the land of his birth."" Throughout, he gives us what amounts to an episodic autobiography that traces his formation as a writer as well as the genesis of Invisible Man. On every page, Ellison reveals his idiosyncratic and often contrarian brilliance, his insistence on refuting both black and white stereotypes of what an African American writer should say or be. The result is a book that continues to instruct, delight, and occasionally outrage readers thirty years after it was first published.",['Ralph Ellison'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=QiXMxUifFs8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.com/books?id=QiXMxUifFs8C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Shadow+and+act&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Vintage,2011-06-01,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=QiXMxUifFs8C&source=gbs_api,['Literary Collections'],
Penrod and Sam,"Newton Booth Tarkington (1869–1946) was an American dramatist and Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist. Among only three other novelists to have won the Pulitzer Prize more than once, Tarkington was one of the greatest authors of the 1910s and 1920s who helped usher in Indiana's Golden Age of literature. First published in 1916, Tarkington's novel “Penrod and Sam” is the second installment to ""The Penrod Series"" and concentrates on the relationship between Penrod Schofield and his best friend, Sam Williams. A charming tale of youth reminiscent of Mark Twain's “Huckleberry Finn” that will not disappoint fans of Tarkington's wonderful work. Other notable works by this author include: “Monsieur Beaucaire” (1900), “The Turmoil” (1915), and “The Magnificent Ambersons” (1918). Read & Co.

Vector Quantization and Signal Compression (The Springer International Series in Engineering and Computer Science),"Herb Caen, a popular columnist for the San Francisco Chronicle, recently quoted a Voice of America press release as saying that it was reorganizing in order to ""eliminate duplication and redundancy. "" This quote both states a goal of data compression and illustrates its common need: the removal of duplication (or redundancy) can provide a more efficient representation of data and the quoted phrase is itself a candidate for such surgery. Not only can the number of words in the quote be reduced without losing informa tion, but the statement would actually be enhanced by such compression since it will no longer exemplify the wrong that the policy is supposed to correct. Here compression can streamline the phrase and minimize the em barassment while improving the English style. Compression in general is intended to provide efficient representations of data while preserving the essential information contained in the data. This book is devoted to the theory and practice of signal compression, i. e. , data compression applied to signals such as speech, audio, images, and video signals (excluding other data types such as financial data or general purpose computer data).

"The Ultimate Guide to Law School Admission: Insider Secrets for Getting a ""Big Envelope"" with Your Acceptance to Law School!","This collection brings together a distinguished group of researchers to examine the power relations which are played out in university law schools as a result of the different pressures exerted upon them by a range of different 'stakeholders'. From students to governments, from lawyers to universities, a host of institutions and actors believe that law schools should take account of a vast number of (often conflicting) considerations when teaching their students, designing curricula, carrying out research and so on. How do law schools deal with these pressures? What should their response be to the 'stakeholders' who urge them to follow agendas emanating from outside the law school itself? To what extent should some of these agendas play a greater role in the thinking of law schools?",['Fiona Cownie'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=KAjcBAAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=KAjcBAAAQBAJ&pg=PA130&dq=The+Ultimate+Guide+to+Law+School+Admission:+Insider+Secrets+for+Getting+a+%22Big+Envelope%22+with+Your+Acceptance+to+Law+School!&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Bloomsbury Publishing,2010-01-28,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=KAjcBAAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Law'],
"The Repeal of Reticence: A History of America's Cultural and Legal Struggles over Free Speech, Obscenity, Sexual Liberation, and Modern Art","At a time when America's faculties of taste and judgment—along with the sense of the sacred and shameful—have become utterly vacant, Rochelle Gurstein's The Repeal of Reticence delivers an important and troubling warning. Covering landmark developments in America's modern culture and law, she charts the demise of what was dismissively called ""gentility"" in the face of First Amendment triumphs for journalists, sex educators, and novelists—from Margaret Sanger's advocacy of birth control to Judge Woolsey's celebrated defense of Ulysses. Weaving together a study of the legal debates over obscenity and free speech with a cultural study of the critics and writers who framed the issues, Gurstein offers a trenchant reconsideration of the sacred value of privacy.",['Rochelle Gurstein'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=6vYwCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,"http://books.google.nl/books?id=6vYwCwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Repeal+of+Reticence:+A+History+of+America%27s+Cultural+and+Legal+Struggles+over+Free+Speech,+Obscenity,+Sexual+Liberation,+and+Modern+Art&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api",Hill and Wang,2016-01-05,https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=6vYwCwAAQBAJ&source=gbs_api,['Political Science'],

The Forbidden Stories of Marta Veneranda,"Marta Veneranda, a Latina neoyorkina, finds that she inspires the confessional in people. In fact, when people come to her, they feel the need to reveal their most embarrassing and shameful stories. And through these reluctantly told tales, where characters enter and leave each other's narrations, Rivera-Valdes revisits and questions our most basic behavioral assumptions. In ""Little Poisons,"" the narrator shares with Marta the minutiae of her self-help book–assisted liberation from her philandering husband, whom she will eventually poison to death, and whose mistress she will befriend: ""In the fifteen years of marriage he would tell me everything, even about his sexual escapades-if he couldn't share them with me, who would he share them with? Besides, that way no one could come running to me spreading rumors."" Beneath the humor is a dead-serious scrutiny of the commingling of Anglo and Latino cultures. At heart, the stories are an exposé of the comforts and discomforts of that cohabitation.",['Sonia Rivera-Valdes'],http://books.google.com/books/content?id=A7aYbAvagu8C&printsec=frontcover&img=1&zoom=1&edge=curl&source=gbs_api,http://books.google.nl/books?id=A7aYbAvagu8C&printsec=frontcover&dq=The+Forbidden+Stories+of+Marta+Veneranda&hl=&cd=1&source=gbs_api,Seven Stories Press,2001-03-06,http://books.google.nl/books?id=A7aYbAvagu8C&dq=The+Forbidden+Stories+of+Marta+Veneranda&hl=&source=gbs_api,['Fiction'],
